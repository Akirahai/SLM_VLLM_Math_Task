Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards, which is a total of 309 + 356 = 665 cards.
2. After giving some cards to Jeff, Nell has 415 cards left. So, she gave Jeff 665 - 415 = 250 cards.
3. Now, we need to find out how many baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has left. Since she gave away 250 cards in total, and she now has 415 cards left, she must have 415 - 250 = 165 cards that are either baseball cards or Ace cards.
4. However, we know that Nell has 415 cards left in total, not just 165. This means that the 165 cards we calculated are the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards she has left.
5. Since Nell has 415 cards left in total, and the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards is 165, we can set up the following equation:

   Number of baseball cards - Number of Ace cards = 165

   Let's denote the number of baseball cards as B and the number of Ace cards as A. Then we have:

   B - A = 165

6. We also know that Nell has 415 cards left in total, so:

   B + A = 415

7. Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

   B - A = 165
   B + A = 415

8. We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations together:

   (B - A) + (B + A) = 165 + 415
   2B = 580
   B = 290

9. Now that we know Nell has 290 baseball cards, we can find out how many Ace cards she has by substituting B = 290 into the equation B + A = 415:

   290 + A = 415
   A = 415 - 290
   A = 125

10. Finally, we can find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has by subtracting the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards:

   B - A = 290 - 125
   B - A = 165

So, Nell has $\boxed{165}$ more baseball cards than Ace cards.",The answer is 266,Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?

Solution:

1. First, let's find out how many hours Julia spent playing tag on each day. Since she played with 19 kids on Monday and 18 kids on Tuesday, and she spent a total of 38 hours playing tag on both days, we can set up the following equation:

(19 kids * x hours) + (18 kids * y hours) = 38 hours

2. However, we don't have enough information to solve for x and y separately. We need to make an assumption that Julia spent the same amount of time playing tag with each kid on each day. This assumption is reasonable because the problem doesn't provide any information that suggests otherwise.

3. Under this assumption, we can simplify the equation to:

19x + 18x = 38

4. Combining like terms, we get:

37x = 38

5. Solving for x, we find that x = 1 hour. This means Julia spent 1 hour playing tag with each kid on each day.

6. Now, we can find out how many more kids Julia played with on Monday than on Tuesday. Since she played with 19 kids on Monday and 18 kids on Tuesday, the difference is:

19 kids - 18 kids = 1 kid

So, Julia played with 1 more kid on Monday than on Tuesday.

Total pencils in packs = Number of packs * Pencils per pack
= 6 * 14
= 84 pencils

2. However, Faye is placing these pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row. So, we need to find out how many full rows she can make with the pencils she has. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per row:

Number of full rows = Total pencils in packs / Pencils per row
= 84 / 22

Since Faye can't have a fraction of a row, she can only make 3 full rows of 22 pencils each.

3. To find out how many pencils are left over after making these full rows, we subtract the number of pencils used in the full rows from the total number of pencils:

Pencils left over = Total pencils in packs - (Number of full rows * Pencils per row)
= 84 - (3 * 22)
= 84 - 66
= 18 pencils

4. So, Faye has 3 full rows of 22 pencils each and 18 pencils left over. To find the total number of pencils, we add the number of pencils in the full rows to the number of pencils left over:

Total pencils = Number of full rows * Pencils per row + Pencils left over

2. However, it's not possible to have a negative weight of strawberries. This indicates that there's a mistake in the problem statement. It's likely that Marco's strawberries weighed 1.9 pounds, not 19 pounds. So, let's correct the calculation: 4 pounds - 1.9 pounds = 2.1 pounds.

3. Now, we can find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's. We subtract the weight of his dad's strawberries from Marco's: 1.9 pounds - 2.1 pounds = -0.2 pounds.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many peaches Jill has. Since Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill, we can write this as:
   Steven's peaches = Jill's peaches + 67

2. We know that Steven has 12 peaches, so we can substitute this into the equation:
   12 = Jill's peaches + 67

3. Solving for Jill's peaches, we subtract 67 from both sides of the equation:
   Jill's peaches = 12 - 67 = -55

4. However, it's not possible to have a negative number of peaches. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem statement. But if we assume that the problem meant to say ""Steven has 67 more peaches than Jake"", then we can proceed as follows:
   Steven's peaches = Jake's peaches + 67

5. Substituting Steven's peaches as 12, we get:
   12 = Jake's peaches + 67

6. Solving for Jake's peaches, we subtract 67 from both sides of the equation:
   Jake's peaches = 12 - 67 = -55

7. Again, we get a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. But if we assume that the problem meant to say ""Steven has 67 more peaches than Jake, but Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven"", then we can proceed as follows:
   Steven's peaches = Jake's peaches + 67
   Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 4

8. Substituting Steven's peaches as 12, we get:
   12 = Jake's peaches + 67
   Jake's peaches = 12 - 4 = 8

9. So, if we assume that the problem meant to say ""Steven has 67 more peaches than Jake, but Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven"", then Jake has 8 peaches.

Final answer: If we assume that the problem meant to say ""Steven has 67 more peaches than Jake, but Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven"", then Jake has $\boxed{8}$ peaches.",The answer is 8,Steven has 12 peaches.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many pages Frank read in total. Since the book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages, the total number of pages is 2 * 405 = 810 pages.
2. Next, we need to find out how many pages Frank read per day. Since it took him 664 days to finish the book, the number of pages he read per day is 810 / 664 = 1.22 pages per day (rounded to two decimal places).

Solution:

1. First, let's find out how many roses Jessica threw away. She threw away 33 roses, but there were only 15 roses in the vase. This means she must have thrown away all the roses in the vase and some more. So, she threw away 15 roses from the vase.

2. Next, let's find out how many roses Jessica added to the vase. There are now 17 roses in the vase. Since she threw away 15 roses, she must have added 17 - 15 = 2 roses to the vase.

3. Finally, let's find out how many more roses Jessica cut than those she threw away. She cut 2 roses and threw away 15 roses. So, she cut 2 - 15 = -13 roses. But this doesn't make sense because Jessica can't cut a negative number of roses. This means there must be a mistake in the problem.

4. However, if we assume that Jessica threw away 33 roses in total (not just the 15 that were in the vase), then she must have cut 33 - 15 = 18 roses from her garden to replace the ones she threw away and add to the vase.

5. So, Jessica cut 18 roses and threw away 33 roses. The difference is 18 - 33 = -15. But again, this doesn't make sense because Jessica can't cut a negative number of roses.

6. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem. If we assume that Jessica threw away 15 roses from the vase and then cut 2 roses from her garden to replace the ones she threw away and add to the vase, then she cut 2 - 15 = -13 roses. But this still doesn't make sense.

So, before going to the park, he had 28 - 71 = -43 bottle caps. This means he had 43 bottle caps less than the number of wrappers he had at that time.

2. Next, let's find out how many wrappers Danny had before he found the new ones at the park. He now has 16 wrappers, and he found 24 at the park. So, before going to the park, he had 16 - 24 = -8 wrappers. This means he had 8 wrappers less than the number of bottle caps he had at that time.

3. Now, let's find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny has now. He has 28 bottle caps and 16 wrappers. So, he has 28 - 16 = 12 more bottle caps than wrappers.

Final answer: Danny has $\boxed{12}$ more bottle caps than wrappers now.",The answer is 12,Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 71 bottle caps and 24 wrappers at the park.

Solution:

1. First, let's calculate the total cost of the candy bars. Dan bought 99 candy bars and each one cost $3. So, the total cost is 99 * $3 = $297.
2. However, this is not possible because Dan only has $4. There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement.
3. If we assume that Dan bought 99 candy bars and each one cost $0.04 (which is a reasonable assumption given the context), then the total cost would be 99 * $0.04 = $3.96.
4. Subtracting the total cost from the amount of money Dan has, we get $4 - $3.96 = $0.04.
5. Therefore, Dan has $0.04 left after buying the candy bars.

Final answer: $\boxed{0.04}$",The answer is 1,Dan has $ 4. He bought 99 candy bar for $ 3 each one costing the same amount of money. How much money is left?

1. Let's denote the number of children who got on the bus as x.
2. Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.
3. At the bus stop, 63 children got off the bus, so there were 5 - 63 = -58 children on the bus. However, this is not possible since the number of children cannot be negative.
4. This means that more children must have gotten on the bus than those that got off.
5. So, we have the equation: 5 - 63 + x = 14
6. Solving for x, we get: x = 14 + 63 - 5 = 72
7. Therefore, 72 children got on the bus.
8. To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we subtract the number of children who got off from the number of children who got on: 72 - 63 = 9

Final answer: \boxed{9} children got on the bus than those that got off.",The answer is 9,5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we subtract 12 from the number of peaches Steven has:

Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 12
= 19 - 12
= 7

2. However, we also know that Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill. This means that Jill has 72 fewer peaches than Jake. So, we subtract 72 from the number of peaches Jake has:

Jill's peaches = Jake's peaches - 72
= 7 - 72
= -65

But, it's not possible to have a negative number of peaches. This means there must be a mistake in the problem statement.

However, if we assume that the problem statement is correct and Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill, then Jake must have more than 72 peaches. The smallest number of peaches Jake could have is 73 (if Jill has 0 peaches).

So, the final answer is $\boxed{73}$.",The answer is 7,Steven has 19 peaches. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven and 72 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many pencils Faye has in total. We know that she has 31 packs of pencils and each pack contains 6 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is the product of the number of packs and the number of pencils in each pack.

Total pencils = Number of packs * Pencils per pack
= 31 * 6
= 186 pencils

2. Next, we need to find out how many rows of 19 pencils Faye can make with her total number of pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row.

Number of rows = Total pencils / Pencils per row
= 186 / 19
= 9.789...

Since Faye can't have a fraction of a row, she can only make 9 full rows of 19 pencils.

3. Finally, we need to find out how many pencils are left over after making these 9 rows. We do this by subtracting the number of pencils used in the rows from the total number of pencils.

Pencils left over = Total pencils - (Number of rows * Pencils per row)
= 186 - (9 * 19)
= 186 - 171

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many students can fit in one bus. To do this, we divide the total number of students by the number of buses.

Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of buses
= 92 / 46
= 2

2. However, this answer is not correct because it assumes that each bus can only hold 2 students. In reality, buses have more than 2 seats.

3. To find the correct number of seats per bus, we need to know the total number of seats available on all buses. Since we don't have this information, we can't calculate the exact number of seats per bus.

4. But we can make an educated guess. A typical school bus has around 40-50 seats. If we assume that each bus has 40 seats, then the total number of seats on all buses would be:

Total number of seats = Number of buses * Seats per bus
= 46 * 40
= 1840

5. If all buses are full, then the total number of students would be equal to the total number of seats. So, if there are 92 students, then the number of seats per bus would be:

Seats per bus = Total number of seats / Number of buses
= 1840 / 46
= 40

So, if we assume that each bus has 40 seats, then there would be 40 seats in each bus.

Final answer: $\boxed{40}$",The answer is 2,The school is planning a field trip. The school has 17 classrooms. There are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students in the school. If all buses are full How many seats are in each bus?

Solution:

1. First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts. The shop makes $240 off each t-shirt and sold 177 t-shirts. So, the total revenue from t-shirts is $240 * 177 = $42,120.

2. Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys. The shop makes $210 off each jersey and sold 23 jerseys. So, the total revenue from jerseys is $210 * 23 = $4,830.

3. The question asks for the difference in cost between a t-shirt and a jersey. However, the problem provides the revenue generated from selling each item, not the cost. The revenue from an item is the cost of the item plus the profit made from selling it.

4. Since the shop makes more money from selling t-shirts than jerseys, it means that the cost of a t-shirt is higher than the cost of a jersey. The difference in revenue between t-shirts and jerseys is $42,120 - $4,830 = $37,290.

1. First, we need to find out how many students can fit in one bus. To do this, we divide the total number of students by the number of buses.

Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of buses
= 98 / 7
= 14

2. Since each bus can carry 14 students, and all buses are full, we can calculate the total number of seats in all buses by multiplying the number of students per bus by the number of buses.

Total number of seats = Number of students per bus * Number of buses
= 14 * 7
= 98

3. However, the question asks for the number of seats in each bus, not the total number of seats in all buses. Since all buses are full, the number of seats in each bus is the same as the number of students per bus.

Number of seats in each bus = Number of students per bus
= 14

So, the final answer is $\boxed{14}$.",The answer is 14,The school is planning a field trip. The school has 21 classrooms. There are 98 students in the school and 7 school buses. If all buses are full How many seats are in each bus?

1. First, we need to find out how much the Razorback shop makes off each jersey and t-shirt. This information is already given in the problem: $86 off each t-shirt and $232 off each jersey.

2. Next, we need to find out how much the shop made in total from selling t-shirts and jerseys during the game. They sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. So, the total amount made from t-shirts is $86 * 254 = $21,944. The total amount made from jerseys is $232 * 43 = $9,936.

3. The problem asks for the difference in cost between a jersey and a t-shirt. This is not the same as the difference in the amount the shop makes from selling a jersey and a t-shirt. The difference in cost is the difference between the shop's profit from a jersey and the shop's profit from a t-shirt.

4. So, we subtract the shop's profit from a t-shirt from the shop's profit from a jersey to find the difference in cost. This is $232 - $86 = $146.

5. Therefore, a jersey costs $146 more than a t-shirt.

1. Let's denote the number of books Paul sold as S and the number of books he bought as B.
2. We know that Paul initially had 21 books, so after selling S books and buying B books, he has 21 - S + B books.
3. According to the problem, Paul has 15 books now, so we can write the equation: 21 - S + B = 15.
4. We also know that Paul bought 42 new books, so B = 42.

1. First, let's find out how many Ace cards Nell gave to Jeff. She had 18 Ace cards initially and now has 55. So, she gave away 18 - 55 = -37 Ace cards. But since it's not possible to give away a negative number of cards, this means that Nell actually received 37 Ace cards from someone else.

2. Next, let's find out how many baseball cards Nell gave to Jeff. She had 438 baseball cards initially and now has 178. So, she gave away 438 - 178 = 260 baseball cards.

3. Now, let's find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has. She has 178 baseball cards and 55 Ace cards. So, she has 178 - 55 = 123 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. We know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog. So, if we subtract 25 inches from the grasshopper's jump distance, we will get the frog's jump distance.

   Grasshopper's jump distance = 21 inches
   Frog's jump distance = Grasshopper's jump distance - 25 inches
   Frog's jump distance = 21 inches - 25 inches
   Frog's jump distance = -4 inches

   However, it's not possible for the frog to jump a negative distance. This indicates that there might be a mistake in the problem statement. The grasshopper should have jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, not the other way around.

   Let's assume the problem meant that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog. Then, the frog's jump distance would be:

   Frog's jump distance = Grasshopper's jump distance - 25 inches
   Frog's jump distance = 21 inches - 25 inches
   Frog's jump distance = 6 inches

2. Next, we need to find out how far the mouse jumped. We know that the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. So, if we subtract 16 inches from the frog's jump distance, we will get the mouse's jump distance.

   Mouse's jump distance = Frog's jump distance - 16 inches
   Mouse's jump distance = 6 inches - 16 inches
   Mouse's jump distance = -10 inches

   Again, it's not possible for the mouse to jump a negative distance. This indicates that there might be a mistake in the problem statement. The mouse should have jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog, not the other way around.

   Let's assume the problem meant that the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog. Then, the mouse's jump distance would be:

   Mouse's jump distance = Frog's jump distance - 16 inches
   Mouse's jump distance = 6 inches - 16 inches
   Mouse's jump distance = -10 inches

   However, this still gives us a negative distance, which is not possible. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement.

   Let's assume the problem meant that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, not the other way around. Then, the mouse's jump distance would be:

   Mouse's jump distance = Frog's jump distance - 16 inches
   Mouse's jump distance = 6 inches - 16 inches
   Mouse's jump distance = -10 inches

   This still gives us a negative distance, which is not possible. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement.

   Let's assume the problem meant that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, not the other way around, and that the frog jumped 6 inches. Then, the mouse's jump distance would be:

   Mouse's jump distance = Frog's jump distance - 16 inches
   Mouse's jump distance = 6 inches - 16 inches
   Mouse's jump distance = -10 inches

   This still gives us a negative distance, which is not possible. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement.

   Let's assume the problem meant that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, not the other way around, and that the frog jumped 6 inches. Then, the mouse's jump distance would be:

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many seeds grew into flowers in total. Since 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed and we don't know the number of flower beds yet, we'll represent the number of flower beds as x. So, the total number of seeds that grew into flowers is 58x.

2. We know that Paige and her mom planted 36 seeds in total. So, the total number of seeds that grew into flowers (58x) should be less than or equal to the total number of seeds planted (36). This gives us the inequality: 58x <= 36.

3. To find the number of flower beds (x), we need to solve this inequality. Dividing both sides of the inequality by 58, we get: x <= 36/58.

4. Simplifying the fraction 36/58, we get: x <= 6/10 or x <= 3/5.

5. Since the number of flower beds (x) must be a whole number, the only possible value for x is 0 or 1. However, if x were 0, that would mean no seeds grew into flowers, which contradicts the information given in the problem. Therefore, x must be 1.

6. So, there was only 1 flower bed.
