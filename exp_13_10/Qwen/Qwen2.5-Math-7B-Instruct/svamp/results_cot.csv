2. **Determine the total number of friends Matthew gave the crackers and cakes to:**
   - Friends: 28

3. **Calculate the number of crackers each friend received:**
   - Since Matthew gave out all the crackers equally, we divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends.
   \[
   \text{Crackers per friend} = \frac{13}{28}
   \]
   However, since 13 is less than 28, each friend cannot receive a whole number of crackers. Therefore, it is impossible to distribute 13 crackers equally among 28 friends without breaking them into smaller pieces.

4. **Calculate the number of cakes each friend received:**
   - Similarly, we divide the total number of cakes by the number of friends.
   \[
   \text{Cakes per friend} = \frac{15}{28}
   \]
   Again, since 15 is less than 28, each friend cannot receive a whole number of cakes. Therefore, it is impossible to distribute 15 cakes equally among 28 friends without breaking them into smaller pieces.

Given the constraints of the problem, it is not possible to distribute 13 crackers and 15 cakes equally among 28 friends without breaking them into smaller pieces. Therefore, the problem as stated is not solvable with whole numbers.

However, if we assume there was a mistake in the problem statement and Matthew had more crackers and cakes to distribute equally, we would need to adjust the numbers accordingly.

For the sake of completeness, if we assume Matthew had enough crackers and cakes to distribute equally, we would need to find a common multiple of 28 that is greater than or equal to both 13 and 15. The smallest common multiple of 28 is 28 itself.

Given the problem constraints, the problem is not solvable with whole numbers. Therefore, the problem as stated is not solvable with whole numbers.

24,24," To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more children got off the bus than those that got on. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial number of children on the bus:**
   \[
   36
   \]

2. **Number of children who got off the bus:**
   \[
   68
   \]

3. **Number of children who got on the bus:**
   Let's denote the number of children who got on the bus as \( x \).

4. **Final number of children on the bus:**
   \[
   12
   \]

5. **Set up the equation:**
   The initial number of children minus the number who got off plus the number who got on equals the final number of children:
   \[
   36 - 68 + x = 12
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   First, simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   36 - 68 = -32
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   -32 + x = 12
   \]
   Add 32 to both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x = 12 + 32
   \]
   \[
   x = 44
   \]

   Therefore, 44 children got on the bus.

   \[
   23
   \]

2. **Number of children who got on the bus:**
   \[
   24
   \]

3. **Number of children who got off the bus:**
   Let's denote the number of children who got off the bus as \( x \).

4. **Total number of children on the bus after the bus stop:**
   According to the problem, after the bus stop, there were 8 children on the bus.

5. **Set up the equation:**
   The total number of children on the bus after the bus stop can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Initial number of children} + \text{Number of children who got on} - \text{Number of children who got off} = \text{Final number of children}

1. Calculate the number of flowers in one garden.
2. Multiply the number of flowers in one garden by the total number of gardens.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of flowers in one garden.**

Each garden has 544 pots, and each pot has 32 flowers. Therefore, the number of flowers in one garden is:
\[ 544 \times 32 \]

To perform the multiplication, we can break it down into simpler steps:
\[ 544 \times 32 = 544 \times (30 + 2) = (544 \times 30) + (544 \times 2) \]

First, calculate \( 544 \times 30 \):
\[ 544 \times 30 = 544 \times 3 \times 10 = 1632 \times 10 = 16320 \]

2. Identify the weight of the strawberries picked by Marco.
3. Calculate the weight of the strawberries picked by his dad.
4. Find the difference between the weight of Marco's strawberries and the weight of his dad's strawberries.

Let's start with the given information:
- The total weight of the strawberries picked by Marco and his dad is 4 pounds.
- Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds.

Since the total weight of the strawberries picked by both Marco and his dad is 4 pounds, and Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds, there seems to be a discrepancy because the total weight of 4 pounds cannot be less than the weight of Marco's strawberries alone. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or interpretation. Let's assume the problem meant to say Marco's strawberries weighed 19 ounces instead of pounds.

Let's correct the problem and solve it again:
- The total weight of the strawberries picked by Marco and his dad is 4 pounds.
- Marco's strawberries weighed 19 ounces.

First, convert 4 pounds to ounces:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries from the total weight to find the weight of his dad's strawberries:
\[ 64 \text{ ounces} - 19 \text{ ounces} = 45 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, find the difference between the weight of Marco's strawberries and the weight of his dad's strawberries:
\[ 19 \text{ ounces} - 45 \text{ ounces} = -26 \text{ ounces} \]

Since the problem statement is still not logical, let's assume the problem meant to say Marco's strawberries weigh 19 pounds and total weight is 4 pounds.

638,638," To determine the total number of pencils and crayons Faye has, we need to calculate the number of pencils and the number of crayons separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of pencils:
- Faye has 31 pencils in each row.
- There are 11 rows.

\[
\text{Total number of pencils} = 31 \text{ pencils/row} \times 11 \text{ rows}
\]

We can break down the multiplication for clarity:
\[
31 \times 11 = 31 \times (10 + 1) = (31 \times 10) + (31 \times 1)
\]

Calculate each part:
\[
31 \times 10 = 310
\]
\[
31 \times 1 = 31
\]

Add these results together:
\[
310 + 31 = 341
\]

So, Faye has 341 pencils.

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons:
- Faye has 27 crayons in each row.
- There are 11 rows.

\[
\text{Total number of crayons} = 27 \text{ crayons/row} \times 11 \text{ rows}
\]

We can break down the multiplication for clarity:
\[
27 \times 11 = 27 \times (10 + 1) = (27 \times 10) + (27 \times 1)
\]

Calculate each part:
\[
27 \times 10 = 270
\]
\[
27 \times 1 = 27
\]

Add these results together:
\[
270 + 27 = 297
\]

So, Faye has 297 crayons.

Finally, we add the total number of pencils and the total number of crayons to find the total number of pencils and crayons altogether:
\[
\text{Total number of pencils and crayons} = 341 + 297
\]

Add these results together:
\[
341 + 297 = 638
\]

Therefore, the total number of pencils and crayons Faye has is \boxed{638}.",The answer is 638,Faye was placing her pencils and crayons into 11 rows with 31 pencils and 27 crayons in each row. How many pencils and crayons does she have altogether?

8722,8722," To determine how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.
2. Identify the profit made per t-shirt.
3. Multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the profit per t-shirt to find the total profit for the Arkansas game.

Given:
- The profit per t-shirt is $98.
- The total number of t-shirts sold during both games is 163.
- The number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game is 89.

First, we need to find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game. We do this by subtracting the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold:

6840,6840," To determine how much carpet Jesse needs to cover the floors of all her rooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area of one room.
2. Multiply the area of one room by the total number of rooms.

**Step 1: Calculate the area of one room.**

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For Jesse's room, the length is 19 feet and the width is 18 feet. So, the area of one room is:
\[ A = 19 \times 18 \]

To find the product, we can use the distributive property:
\[ 19 \times 18 = 19 \times (20 - 2) = 19 \times 20 - 19 \times 2 \]
\[ 19 \times 20 = 380 \]
\[ 19 \times 2 = 38 \]
\[ 380 - 38 = 342 \]

So, the area of one room is 342 square feet.

**Step 2: Multiply the area of one room by the total number of rooms.**

Jesse has 20 rooms. Therefore, the total area of all the rooms is:
\[ \text{Total area} = 342 \times 20 \]

To find the product, we can use the fact that multiplying by 20 is the same as multiplying by 2 and then by 10:
\[ 342 \times 20 = 342 \times (2 \times 10) = (342 \times 2) \times 10 \]
\[ 342 \times 2 = 684 \]

26180,26180," To determine the total number of bananas in Philip's collection, we need to multiply the number of groups by the size of each group. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the number of groups: 140
2. Identify the size of each group: 187
3. Multiply the number of groups by the size of each group: \(140 \times 187\)

Now, let's perform the multiplication step by step.

First, break down the multiplication into simpler parts using the distributive property:
\[140 \times 187 = 140 \times (190 - 3) = 140 \times 190 - 140 \times 3\]

Next, calculate \(140 \times 190\):
\[140 \times 190 = 140 \times (200 - 10) = 140 \times 200 - 140 \times 10\]
\[140 \times 200 = 28000\]
\[140 \times 10 = 1400\]
\[140 \times 190 = 28000 - 1400 = 26600\]

Now, calculate \(140 \times 3\):
\[140 \times 3 = 420\]

Finally, subtract \(140 \times 3\) from \(140 \times 190\):
\[140 \times 187 = 26600 - 420 = 26180\]

Therefore, the total number of bananas in Philip's collection is \(\boxed{26180}\).",The answer is 26180,There are some bananas in Philip's banana collection. If the bananas are organized into 140 groups of size 187 How many bananas does he have in his collection?

17,17," Let's denote the number of marbles Doug originally had as \( d \). According to the problem, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed originally had \( d + 2 \) marbles.

After losing some marbles at the playground, Doug now has \( d - x \) marbles, where \( x \) is the number of marbles Doug lost. At this point, Ed still has \( d + 2 \) marbles. The problem states that now Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ d + 2 = (d - x) + 19 \]

Next, we simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ d + 2 = d - x + 19 \]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract \( d \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2 = -x + 19 \]

Then, we subtract 19 from both sides:

\[ 2 - 19 = -x \]

This simplifies to:

\[ -17 = -x \]

Finally, we multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 17 \]

So, Doug lost \(\boxed{17}\) marbles.",The answer is 17,Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?

Let's start with the information given:
- Steven has 15 peaches.
- Steven has 14 more peaches than Jill.
- Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven.

First, we need to find out how many peaches Jill has. Since Steven has 14 more peaches than Jill, we can express this relationship as:
\[ \text{Steven's peaches} = \text{Jill's peaches} + 14 \]
We know Steven has 15 peaches, so we can substitute 15 for Steven's peaches:
\[ 15 = \text{Jill's peaches} + 14 \]

324775,324775," To determine how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lewis's total earnings over the 1181 weeks.
2. Calculate Lewis's total rent over the 1181 weeks.
3. Subtract the total rent from the total earnings to find out how much money Lewis will have left.

**Step 1: Calculate Lewis's total earnings over the 1181 weeks.**

Lewis earns $491 every week. Therefore, his total earnings over 1181 weeks is:
\[ 491 \times 1181 \]

To perform the multiplication:
\[ 491 \times 1181 = 491 \times (1200 - 19) = 491 \times 1200 - 491 \times 19 \]
\[ 491 \times 1200 = 589200 \]
\[ 491 \times 19 = 9329 \]
\[ 589200 - 9329 = 579871 \]

So, Lewis's total earnings over the 1181 weeks is $579871.

**Step 2: Calculate Lewis's total rent over the 1181 weeks.**

Lewis pays $216 rent every week. Therefore, his total rent over 1181 weeks is:
\[ 216 \times 1181 \]

To perform the multiplication:
\[ 216 \times 1181 = 216 \times (1200 - 19) = 216 \times 1200 - 216 \times 19 \]
\[ 216 \times 1200 = 259200 \]
\[ 216 \times 19 = 4104 \]
\[ 259200 - 4104 = 255096 \]

So, Lewis's total rent over the 1181 weeks is $255096.

9,9," To solve the problem step by step, let's start by identifying the initial number of children on the bus and the number of children who got off and on the bus.

1. Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.
2. At the bus stop, 63 children got off the bus.
3. After some more children got on the bus, there were 14 children altogether on the bus.

Let's denote the number of children who got on the bus as \( x \).

First, we calculate the number of children on the bus after 63 children got off:
\[ 5 - 63 = -58 \]
This means there were -58 children on the bus after 63 children got off (i.e., 58 children were missing).

Next, we add the number of children who got on the bus to the number of children remaining on the bus:
\[ -58 + x = 14 \]
To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 14 + 58 \]
\[ x = 72 \]
So, 72 children got on the bus.

Now, we need to find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off:
\[ 72 - 63 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of children who got on the bus is 9 more than the number of children who got off. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]",The answer is 9,5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?

2,2," Let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the information given in the problem.

Let \( x \) be the number of cups of flour Mary has already put in. According to the problem, the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. This means that the amount of flour she still needs to add is \( 10 - x \), and this amount is 5 more than the amount of sugar she needs to add, which is \( 3 - y \), where \( y \) is the amount of sugar she has already put in. However, since the problem does not specify how much sugar she has already put in, we can assume she has not put in any sugar yet, so she still needs 3 cups of sugar. Therefore, the equation becomes:

\[ 10 - x = 5 + 3 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 10 - x = 8 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:

\[ 10 - 8 = x \]

\[ x = 2 \]

   \[
   49 \times 233
   \]
   To perform the multiplication:
   \[
   49 \times 233 = 49 \times (200 + 30 + 3) = (49 \times 200) + (49 \times 30) + (49 \times 3)
   \]
   Now, calculate each term separately:
   \[
   49 \times 200 = 9800

9,9," Let's denote the number of pieces of candy Bobby ate at the start as \( x \).

1. Bobby initially had 22 pieces of candy.
2. After eating \( x \) pieces of candy, he had \( 22 - x \) pieces of candy left.
3. Then he ate 5 more pieces of candy, so he had \( (22 - x) - 5 = 17 - x \) pieces of candy left.
4. According to the problem, after eating these additional 5 pieces, Bobby still has 8 pieces of candy left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   17 - x = 8
   \]
5. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation. First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   17 - x - 8 = 8 - 8
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   9 - x = 0
   \]
6. Next, add \( x \) to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   9 - x + x = 0 + x
   \]

First, let's calculate the total number of people in the program:
\[
61 \text{ (parents)} + 177 \text{ (pupils)} = 238 \text{ (total people)}
\]

Next, we know that the program could seat 44 people. Since the problem does not specify how many people were not seated, we assume that all 44 seats were filled. Therefore, the number of people present in the program is:
\[
238 \text{ (total people)} - (238 - 44) = 44 \text{ (seats filled)}
\]

However, if we interpret the problem as asking how many people were present in the program without any specific information about seating capacity or unseated people, we can assume that all parents and pupils were present. Thus, the number of people present in the program is:
\[
61 \text{ (parents)} + 177 \text{ (pupils)} = 238 \text{ (people present)}
\]

Given the problem's context and the reference solution, it seems there might be a misinterpretation. Let's recheck the problem statement and assumptions. If we assume the program was filled to capacity and no one was absent, then the number of people present is:
\[

2. Calculate the total profit from selling all the jerseys.
3. Calculate the total profit from selling all the t-shirts.
4. Find the difference between the total profit from t-shirts and the total profit from jerseys.

Let's start with the given information:
- Profit per jersey: $210
- Profit per t-shirt: $240
- Number of t-shirts sold: 177
- Number of jerseys sold: 23

First, calculate the total profit from selling the jerseys:
\[
\text{Total profit from jerseys} = \text{Profit per jersey} \times \text{Number of jerseys} = 210 \times 23
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[
210 \times 23 = 210 \times (20 + 3) = 210 \times 20 + 210 \times 3 = 4200 + 630 = 4830
\]

So, the total profit from selling the jerseys is $4830.

Next, calculate the total profit from selling the t-shirts:
\[
\text{Total profit from t-shirts} = \text{Profit per t-shirt} \times \text{Number of t-shirts} = 240 \times 177
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[

The mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks. Therefore, the total number of pieces of junk mail is:
\[ 32 \times 55 \]

We can break this multiplication down for simplicity:
\[ 32 \times 55 = 32 \times (50 + 5) = (32 \times 50) + (32 \times 5) \]
\[ 32 \times 50 = 1600 \]
\[ 32 \times 5 = 160 \]
\[ 1600 + 160 = 1760 \]

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of bananas in each group and the number of oranges in each group. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of bananas in each group:**
   - There are 203 bananas in total.
   - These bananas are organized into 7 groups.
   - To find out how many bananas are in each group, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups.

2080,2080," To determine the total number of sacks of oranges harvested after 26 days, we need to calculate the daily total of ripe and unripe oranges and then multiply by the number of days.

First, let's find the total number of sacks of oranges harvested per day:
- Sacks of ripe oranges per day: 28
- Sacks of unripe oranges per day: 52

Adding these together gives:
\[
28 + 52 = 80
\]

So, they harvest 80 sacks of oranges per day.

Next, we need to find out how many sacks of oranges they will have after 26 days. We do this by multiplying the daily total by the number of days:
\[
80 \times 26
\]

To perform the multiplication, we can break it down into simpler steps:
\[
80 \times 26 = 80 \times (20 + 6) = (80 \times 20) + (80 \times 6)
\]

Calculating each part separately:
\[
80 \times 20 = 1600
\]
\[
80 \times 6 = 480
\]

5,10," Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as \( A \) and the number of apples Jackie has as \( J \). According to the problem, together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples. This can be written as:

\[ A + J = 6 \]

The problem also states that Adam has 4 apples more than Jackie. This can be written as:

\[ A = J + 4 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( A + J = 6 \)
2. \( A = J + 4 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( A \):

\[ (J + 4) + J = 6 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2J + 4 = 6 \]

Next, subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2J = 2 \]

Then, divide both sides by 2:

\[ J = 1 \]

Now that we know Jackie has 1 apple, we can substitute \( J = 1 \) back into the second equation to find \( A \):

\[ A = 1 + 4 \]

So, Adam has:

\[ A = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of apples Adam has is \(\boxed{5}\).",The answer is 10,Together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples. He has 4 apples more than adam and jackie together do. How many apples does he have?

To make the multiplication easier, we can break it down using the distributive property:
\[ 62 \times 183 = 62 \times (180 + 3) = (62 \times 180) + (62 \times 3) \]

First, calculate \( 62 \times 180 \):
\[ 62 \times 180 = 62 \times (18 \times 10) = (62 \times 18) \times 10 \]

Next, calculate \( 62 \times 18 \):
\[ 62 \times 18 = 62 \times (20 - 2) = (62 \times 20) - (62 \times 2) \]
\[ 62 \times 20 = 1240 \]
\[ 62 \times 2 = 124 \]
\[ 62 \times 18 = 1240 - 124 = 1116 \]

Now, multiply by 10:
\[ 1116 \times 10 = 11160 \]

123,123," To determine how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   - Baseball cards: 438
   - Ace cards: 18

2. **Cards given to Jeff:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of baseball cards given to Jeff.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Ace cards given to Jeff.

3. **Remaining cards after giving some to Jeff:**
   - Baseball cards left: 178
   - Ace cards left: 55

4. **Set up equations based on the remaining cards:**
   - \( 438 - x = 178 \)
   - \( 18 - y = 55 \)

5. **Solve for \( x \) and \( y \):**
   - For \( x \):
     \[
     438 - x = 178
     \]
     Subtract 178 from both sides:
     \[
     438 - 178 = x
     \]
     \[
     x = 260
     \]

   - For \( y \):
     \[
     18 - y = 55
     \]
     Subtract 55 from both sides:
     \[
     18 - 55 = y

53433,1791," To determine the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 89 days, we need to add up the number of visitors for each of the three given days and then use this information to find the total for the remaining days.

First, let's calculate the total number of visitors for the three given days:
-visitors on the most recent day: 512
-visitors on the previous day: 471
-visitors on the day before that: 808

Adding these together:
\[ 512 + 471 + 808 = 1791 \]

This means that over the past three days, a total of 1791 visitors came to Buckingham Palace. Since we are asked to find the total number of visitors over the past 89 days, we need to determine how many days are left after these three days. The number of remaining days is:
\[ 89 - 3 = 86 \]

If we assume that the number of visitors on each of the remaining 86 days is the same as the average number of visitors over the past three days, we can calculate the average number of visitors per day over these three days:
\[ \frac{1791}{3} = 597 \]

Therefore, the total number of visitors over the remaining 86 days is:
\[ 597 \times 86 = 51642 \]

Adding this to the total number of visitors over the past three days gives us the total number of visitors over the past 89 days:
\[ 1791 + 51642 = 53433 \]

Thus, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace within the past 89 days is:
\[ \boxed{53433} \]",The answer is 1791,"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 512 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day.

3021,3021," To determine the total number of white t-shirts mom will have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of white t-shirts in the packages.
2. Add the number of white t-shirts to the number of trousers.

First, let's calculate the total number of white t-shirts in the packages. Mom buys 57 packages, and each package contains 53 white t-shirts. So, we multiply the number of packages by the number of t-shirts per package:

\[ 57 \times 53 \]

To perform the multiplication, we can use the distributive property:

\[ 57 \times 53 = 57 \times (50 + 3) = (57 \times 50) + (57 \times 3) \]

Now, let's calculate each part separately:

\[ 57 \times 50 = 2850 \]
\[ 57 \times 3 = 171 \]

Adding these two results together gives:

\[ 2850 + 171 = 3021 \]

So, mom has 3021 white t-shirts. The problem also mentions that she has 34 trousers, but we are only asked how many white t-shirts she has. Therefore, the number of white t-shirts mom will have is:

\[ \boxed{3021} \]",The answer is 3021,White t - shirts can be purchased in packages of 53. If mom buys 57 packages of white t - shirts and 34 trousers How many white t - shirts will she have?

     \]
   - Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 108 and 252. The GCD of 108 and 252 is 36.
     \[
     \frac{108 \div 36}{252 \div 36} = \frac{3}{7}
     \]
   - Therefore, each picker fills \(\frac{3}{7}\) of a drum per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of drums filled by all pickers in one day:**
   - Since there are 252 pickers, we multiply the number of drums filled by one picker per day by the total number of pickers:
     \[
     \text{Total drums per day} = 252 \text{ pickers} \times \frac{3}{7} \text{ drums per picker per day}
     \]
   - Perform the multiplication:
     \[
     252 \times \frac{3}{7} = 252 \div 7 \times 3 = 36 \times 3 = 108

2. Determine the total number of houses the mailman has to deliver the junk mail to.
3. Divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the total number of houses to find out how many pieces of junk mail each house gets.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The mailman has to give 38 pieces of junk mail to each of the 78 blocks. So, the total number of pieces of junk mail is:
   \[
   38 \times 78
   \]

   To calculate \(38 \times 78\), we can use the distributive property:
   \[
   38 \times 78 = 38 \times (80 - 2) = 38 \times 80 - 38 \times 2
   \]
   Now, calculate each term separately:
   \[
   38 \times 80 = 3040
   \]
   \[
   38 \times 2 = 76
   \]
   Subtract the second term from the first:

\text{Dean's height} = \text{Ron's height} - 6 = 15 - 6 = 9 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we know that the depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. So, we can calculate the depth of the water as follows:
\[
\text{Depth of the water} = 9 \times \text{Dean's height} = 9 \times 9 = 81 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the depth of the water is \boxed{81}.",The answer is 81,After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. If Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron How deep was the water?
