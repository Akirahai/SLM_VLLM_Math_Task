Step 1: Let's denote the number of boys as B.

Step 2: We know that the total number of students is 697 girls + B boys.

Step 3: We also know that there are 228 more girls than boys, so the total number of students can be written as:

Total students = 697 + B - 228 * (B/697)

Step 4: Since the total number of students is given as a whole number, we can say that the right side of the equation must be a whole number. This means that the term 228 * (B/697) must be an integer.

Step 5: To find the number of boys, we need to solve the equation:

697 + B - 228 * (B/697) = Total students (a whole number)

Step 6: Unfortunately, it's not possible to solve this equation algebraically for a specific value of B. However, we can use trial and error to find a solution.

Step 7: Let's start by assuming a small number for B, say 100. Then, we can calculate 228 * (100/697) and see if the result is an integer. If it's not, we can adjust B and try again.

Step 8: After some trial and error, we find that when B = 343, the term 228 * (B/697) is an integer, and the total number of students is also a whole number.

Step 9: So, the number of boys in the school is \boxed{343}.",The answer is 469,In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys How many boys are there in that school?

Step 1: Let's find the difference in the number of visitors between the two days.
Difference = Visitors on the previous day - Visitors on that day
Difference = 703 - 246
Difference = 457

Step 2: Now, let's assume that the number of visitors remains constant for the remaining 24 days.
Daily visitors = Difference / Number of days
Daily visitors = 457 / 24
Daily visitors ≈ 19.04

Step 3: Since we cannot have a fraction of a visitor, let's round up the daily visitors to 20.

Step 4: To find the total number of visitors within 25 days, we multiply the daily visitors by the number of days.
Total visitors = Daily visitors * Number of days
Total visitors = 20 * 25

Step 1: Let's denote the number of push-ups Zachary did as P and the number of crunches as C.

Step 2: We know that P = 35 and C = 3.

Step 3: David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can write the number of push-ups David did as P + 58.

Step 4: David did 87 less crunches than Zachary, so we can write the number of crunches David did as C - 87.

Step 5: Since the number of push-ups David did is equal to the number of crunches Zachary did, we can write the equation: P + 58 = C - 87.

Step 6: We can solve this equation for the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches Zachary did. First, let's add 87 to both sides of the equation: P + 58 + 87 = C.

Step 7: Simplify the left side of the equation: P + 87 + 58 = C.

Step 8: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation: P + 145 = C.

Step 9: Now, we know that P = 35, so we can substitute that value into the equation: 35 + 145 = C.

Step 10: Solve for C: C = 180.

Step 11: Since Zachary did 3 crunches, the number of push-ups Zachary did is 180 - 3 = \boxed{177}.

Step 1: Let's denote the number of kids Julia played with on Monday as M and the number of kids she played with on Tuesday as T.

Step 2: We know that M + T = 12 (from Monday) and T = 14 (from Tuesday).

Step 3: To find the value of M, we can substitute T in the first equation: M + 14 = 12.

Step 4: Solving for M, we get M = 12 - 14 = -2. However, since the number of kids cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculation.

Step 5: Let's reconsider the problem. We know that the total number of hours spent playing tag is 34. Let H be the number of hours spent playing tag on Monday and T be the number of hours spent playing tag on Tuesday.

Step 6: We have the equation H + T = 34 (total hours) and T = 14 (hours on Tuesday).

Step 7: Substituting T in the first equation, we get H + 14 = 34.

Step 8: Solving for H, we get H = 34 - 14 = 20.

Step 9: Since we know that the number of kids playing on Monday is M, we can find M by using the total hours spent playing tag on Monday, which is H = 20 hours.

Step 10: To find the total number of kids, we can use the total hours spent playing tag and the hours spent playing tag on Monday: M * (total hours) / hours on Monday = (12 + 14) * 20 / 20 = 26 kids.

Nell does not have more baseball cards than Ace cards.,266,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many Ace cards Jeff took from Nell.

We know that Nell had 356 Ace cards initially and now has 415 cards left. So, the number of Ace cards Jeff took is:

\boxed{Ace cards taken = Initial Ace cards - Remaining Ace cards}
\boxed{Ace cards taken = 356 - 415 = -59}

Since the number of Ace cards taken is negative, it means that Jeff actually gave Nell more Ace cards instead of taking them away. In this case, we can assume that Nell gave Jeff some of her Ace cards, and we need to find out how many.

Step 2: Now, let's find out how many baseball cards Jeff took from Nell.

We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards initially and now has 415 cards left. So, the number of baseball cards Jeff took is:

\boxed{Baseball cards taken = Initial baseball cards - Remaining baseball cards}
\boxed{Baseball cards taken = 309 - 415 = -106}

Again, since the number of baseball cards taken is negative, it means that Jeff actually gave Nell more baseball cards instead of taking them away. In this case, we can assume that Nell gave Jeff some of her baseball cards, and we need to find out how many.

Step 3: Now, let's find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has after giving some cards to Jeff.

First, let's find out how many Ace cards Nell has now (after giving some to Jeff). Since we know that Jeff took away fewer Ace cards than baseball cards, Nell must have more Ace cards now than she had initially.

\boxed{Remaining Ace cards = Initial Ace cards - Ace cards taken}
\boxed{Remaining Ace cards = 356 - (-59) = 415}

Next, let's find out how many baseball cards Nell has now (after giving some to Jeff). Since we know that Jeff took away fewer baseball cards than Ace cards, Nell must have more baseball cards now than she had initially.

\boxed{Remaining baseball cards = Initial baseball cards - Baseball cards taken}
\boxed{Remaining baseball cards = 309 - (-106) = 415}

Since Nell has the same number of both Ace and baseball cards now, the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards is zero.

\boxed{Difference = Remaining baseball cards - Remaining Ace cards}
\boxed{Difference = 415 - 415 = 0}

So, Nell does not have more baseball cards than Ace cards after giving some cards to Jeff.

Final answer: \boxed{Nell does not have more baseball cards than Ace cards.}",The answer is 266,Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards.

Customers who left = Initial number - Final number with remaining customers
= 12 - 14
= -2

However, since it's not possible to have a negative number of customers, it means that our initial assumption about some customers leaving was incorrect. Let's assume that the number of customers who left is actually zero, and all the customers who initially came were the ones he had at the end.

Step 2: Now, let's find out how many new customers he got. We know that he got 10 new customers.

Step 3: To find the total number of customers he has now, we add the number of customers he had initially (12) to the number of new customers he got (10):

Step 1: Let's denote the distance the grasshopper jumped as G.
The frog jumped 10 inches more than the grasshopper, so we can denote the frog's jump as F = G + 10.
The mouse jumped 20 inches more than the frog, so we can denote the mouse's jump as M = F + 20.

Step 2: We are given that the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can write the equation M - G = 20.

Step 3: Substitute the expressions for F and G from Step 1 into the equation from Step 2: M - (G + 10) = 20.

Step 4: Solve for G: G = M - 10 - 20 = M - 30.

Step 5: Substitute the expression for G back into the equation for F: F = G + 10 = (M - 30) + 10 = M - 20.

Step 6: Substitute the expressions for G and F back into the equation for M: M = F + 20 = (M - 20) + 20 = 2M - 20.

Step 7: Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
M - 20 = 2(M - 30)

Step 8: Solve the system of equations:
M - 20 = 2M - 60
-40 = M - 60
M = 20

Step 9: Now we can find the distance the grasshopper jumped: G = M - 30 = 20 - 30 = -10.

Step 10: Since the distance cannot be negative, there seems to be a mistake in the problem. However, if we assume that the grasshopper jumped 10 inches instead, the problem becomes solvable:
G = 10
F = G + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20
M = F + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40

There is no exact number for the peaches Jake has.,8,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of peaches Jill has as x.
Step 2: Since Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill, we can write the equation for Steven's peaches as:
Steven's peaches = Jill's peaches + 67
x + 12 = x + 67

Step 3: Now, let's denote the number of peaches Jake has as y. Since Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, we can write the equation for Jake's peaches as:
Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 4
y = (x + 67) - 4

Step 4: Now we have two equations with two variables:
x + 12 = x + 67
y = (x + 67) - 4

Step 5: To solve for x, we can first solve the first equation for x:
x + 12 = x + 67
12 = 67

This equation is not true, so there is no solution for x. However, since we are looking for the number of peaches Jake has, we can still find the answer by substituting the incorrect value of x back into the equation for Jake's peaches:
y = (x + 67) - 4
y = (incorrect_x + 67) - 4

Step 6: Since there is no solution for x, we cannot find the exact number of peaches Jake has. However, we can say that Jake has a number of peaches that is 67 more than the number of peaches Jill has, and 4 fewer than the number of peaches Steven has.

Final answer: \boxed{There is no exact number for the peaches Jake has.}",The answer is 8,Steven has 12 peaches. Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven who has 67 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?

We are given the following information:

A + N = Initial number of apps
A - D = Final number of apps

Step 2: We know the initial number of apps was 15, the final number of apps was 14, and the number of new apps he added was 71.

So, we can write the equations:

A + N = 15 + 71
A - D = 14

Step 3: Solve the first equation for A:

A = 15 + 71 - N

Step 4: Now, substitute this expression for A into the second equation:

(15 + 71 - N) - D = 14

Step 5: Solve for D:

15 + 71 - N - D = 14
D = 15 + 71 - 14 - N

Step 6: Since we don't have a specific value for N, we can't find an exact number for D. However, we can express the difference between the number of apps he deleted and the number of apps he added in terms of N:

D = 82 - N

Step 1: First, let's find out how many baseball cards Nell gave to Jeff. To do this, we'll subtract the number of baseball cards she has now from the original number of baseball cards she had.

Original baseball cards = 246
Current baseball cards = 404

Baseball cards given to Jeff = Original baseball cards - Current baseball cards
                                            = 246 - 404
                                            = -158

Since the number of cards given to Jeff is negative, it means that Jeff actually received more baseball cards than Nell had. This is not possible, so there must be an error in the problem.

Step 2: Let's check the number of Ace cards.

Original Ace cards = 214
Current Ace cards = 495

Ace cards given to Jeff = Original Ace cards - Current Ace cards
                                        = 214 - 495
                                        = -281

Again, the number of Ace cards given to Jeff is negative, which is not possible. There must be an error in the problem.

Step 3: Let's re-examine the problem. If Nell has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards now, it means that she has more Ace cards than baseball cards.

Difference between Ace cards and baseball cards = Ace cards - Baseball cards
                                                                        = 495 - 404

Cookies_per_guest = 18 - 9 * Cookies_per_guest
Cookies_per_guest + 9 * Cookies_per_guest = 18
10 * Cookies_per_guest = 18
Cookies_per_guest = 18 / 10

Step 1: Find the total number of seats available on all the school buses.
Total seats = Number of students * Seats per student
Total seats = 111 students * 3 seats/student = \boxed{333 seats}

Step 2: Determine the number of students that can be accommodated on one bus.
Students per bus = Total seats / Seats per bus
Students per bus = 333 seats / 3 seats/bus = \boxed{111 students/bus}

Step 3: Since there are 111 students in the school, we can find the number of buses needed by dividing the total number of students by the number of students that can be accommodated on one bus.
Buses needed = Total students / Students per bus
Buses needed = 111 students / 111 students/bus = \boxed{1 bus}

925 + (Constant visitors * 55),745,"

Step 1: First, let's find out the number of visitors on the second day. Since there were 188 visitors the previous day, we can assume that the number of visitors on the second day is the number of visitors on the first day (the day they went to see the Buckingham palace) minus the number of visitors on the previous day.

Visitors on the second day = Visitors on the first day - Visitors on the previous day
= Total visitors - Visitors on the previous day
= 557 - 188
= \boxed{369}

Step 2: Now, we need to find out the number of visitors on each day for the remaining 55 days. Since we don't have specific information about the daily visitor count, we can't calculate the exact number of visitors for each day. However, we can assume that the number of visitors per day remains constant (ignoring weekends, holidays, or other factors that might affect the number of visitors).

Step 3: To find the total number of visitors within 57 days, we can add the number of visitors on the first day, the number of visitors on the second day, and the assumed constant number of visitors for the remaining 55 days.

Total visitors within 57 days = Visitors on the first day + Visitors on the second day + (Constant visitors * Remaining days)
= 557 + 369 + (Constant visitors * 55)

Since we don't have the constant number of visitors per day, we can't provide the exact total number of visitors within 57 days. However, we can express the total number of visitors within 57 days as the sum of the first two days' visitors and the product of the constant daily visitors and the remaining days.

Total visitors within 57 days = 557 + 369 + (Constant visitors * 55)

answer: Jill has 1 more peach than Jake.,1,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of peaches Jill has as J, the number of peaches Jake has as K, and the number of peaches Steven has as S.

Step 2: We know that S = J + 11 and S = K + 12.

Step 3: Since S is the same for both equations, we can set them equal to each other:

J + 11 = K + 12

Step 4: To solve for the difference between J and K, we first subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:

J = K + 12 - 11

Step 5: Simplify the equation:

J = K + 1

Step 6: Now we know that the difference between J and K is 1. To find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we subtract the number of peaches Jake has from the number of peaches Jill has:

Jill's peaches - Jake's peaches = J - K

Step 7: Since we know that J = K + 1, we can substitute J in the equation:

(K + 1) - K = J - K

Step 8: Simplify the equation:

1 = J - K

Step 9: Since we are asked to find the difference between Jill's and Jake's peaches, we want J - K to be positive. In this case, Jill has more peaches than Jake.

Step 1: Let's represent the amount of money Olivia had at each step with a variable. Let A be the amount of money she had after visiting the ATM, and B be the amount of money she had after visiting the supermarket.

Step 2: We know that A = 100 + 148 = 248 dollars.

Step 3: We also know that B = 248 - amount spent = 159 dollars.

Step 4: To find the amount spent, we can subtract the initial amount from the amount after the supermarket visit.

Step 5: So, amount spent = B - A = 159 - 248 = -89 dollars.

However, since it's not possible to spend a negative amount of money, we made an error in our calculation. Let's reconsider the problem.

Step 1: Let's represent the amount of money Olivia had at each step with a variable. Let A be the amount of money she had after visiting the ATM, and B be the amount of money she had after visiting the supermarket.

Step 2: We know that A = 100 + 148 = 248 dollars.

Step 3: We also know that B = 248 - amount spent = 159 dollars.

Step 4: Since the amount spent is a positive number, we can rewrite the equation for B as B = 248 - amount spent.

Step 5: We know that B = 159, so we can solve for the amount spent by subtracting 159 from 248.

   D + 30 = 36 - M

Step 5: To solve this system, we can either use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

   From the first equation, we can find M = 36 - 22 = 14.

   Now substitute M = 14 in the second equation:

    D + 30 = 36 - 14
    D + 30 = 22
    D = 22 - 30 = -8 (This answer is not possible because weight cannot be negative.)

Step 1: Let's denote the number of books as B and the number of pens as P.

Step 2: We know that the cost of books is $4 and the cost of pens is $3. So, we can write two equations:

   a) Cost of books = Price per book * Number of books
   b) Cost of pens = Price per pen * Number of pens

Step 3: From the problem, we know that the total cost of books and pens is $12. So, we can write another equation:

   c) Total cost = Cost of books + Cost of pens

Step 4: Now we have three equations and two variables (B and P). We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method. Let's use the substitution method.

   From a) and b), we can express the cost of books and pens in terms of B and P:

   Cost of books = 4 = 4 * B
   Cost of pens = 3 = 3 * P

   Now, let's solve for B in terms of P:

   B = 4 / 4 = 1 (Books)

answer: There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. It is not possible for Jake to have -9 peaches.,9,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of peaches Jill has as J.
Step 2: Since Jake has 9 more peaches than Jill, we can write this as Jake = J + 9.
Step 3: We know that Steven has 16 peaches, and he has 7 more peaches than Jake. So, Steven = Jake + 7.
Step 4: Now we have two equations with two variables:
   - Jake + 9 = J + Steven
   - Jake + 7 = Steven
Step 5: We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, let's isolate Steven in the second equation: Steven - Jake = 7.
Step 6: Now substitute this expression for Steven in the first equation: (J + 9) - (Steven - Jake) = J + Steven.
Step 7: Simplify the equation: J + 9 - (Steven - Jake) = J + (Steven - Jake) + 16.
Step 8: Substitute the expression for Steven from the second equation: J + 9 - (J + 7 - Jake) = J + (J + 7 - Jake) + 16.
Step 9: Solve for Jake: 2J + 16 = 2J + 23 - Jake.
Step 10: Subtract 2J from both sides: 16 = 7 - Jake.
Step 11: Solve for Jake: Jake = 7 - 16 = -9.

The number of push-ups Zachary did is 30 fewer than the number of push-ups John did.,30,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of push-ups Zachary did as Z.
   David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can denote the number of push-ups David did as D = Z + 39.
   John did 9 push-ups less than David, so we can denote the number of push-ups John did as J = D - 9.

Step 2: Now we have three equations:
   Z = number of push-ups Zachary did
   D = Z + 39
   J = D - 9

Step 3: We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use substitution.
   First, find the value of D in terms of Z: D = Z + 39
   Then, substitute D in the equation for J: J = (Z + 39) - 9
   Simplify the equation: J = Z + 30

Step 4: Now we have two equations with one variable:
   Z = number of push-ups Zachary did
   J = Z + 30

Step 5: Solve the second equation for Z: Z = J - 30

Step 6: Now that we have the value of Z, we can find the difference between the number of push-ups Zachary did and the number of push-ups John did:
   Difference = Z - J = (J - 30) - J = -30 - J

Step 7: Since we don't know the value of J, we can't find the exact difference. However, we know that Zachary did more push-ups than John, and the difference is -30 push-ups less than the number of push-ups John did.

Final answer: \boxed{The number of push-ups Zachary did is 30 fewer than the number of push-ups John did.}",The answer is 30,Zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class today. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?

Step 2: We know that E = D + 2 (Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug initially).

Step 3: Now, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so we can write the equation E - Doug's loss = D + 19.

Step 4: Since we know that E = D + 2, we can substitute E in the second equation: (D + 2) - Doug's loss = D + 19.

Step 5: To solve for Doug's loss, we need to isolate Doug's loss on one side of the equation. First, let's subtract D from both sides: (D + 2) - D - Doug's loss = D + 19 - D.

Step 6: Simplify the equation: 2 - Doug's loss = 19.

Step 7: Finally, to find Doug's loss, subtract 2 from both sides: Doug's loss = 19 - 2.

Total bottle caps = New bottle caps - Old bottle caps thrown away

Step 2: We are given that Danny has 52 bottle caps in his collection now. So,

52 = 48 (new bottle caps) - Old bottle caps thrown away

Step 3: To find the number of old bottle caps thrown away, we subtract the number of new bottle caps from the total number of bottle caps.

Old bottle caps thrown away = Total bottle caps - New bottle caps

6,3,"

Step 1: Let's denote the amount of money Gwen received from her dad as D and the amount of money she received from her mom as M.

Step 2: We know that D + M = 5 + 2 = 7 (since she received 7 dollars in total from both her parents).

Step 3: We also know that she spent 6 dollars. So, D - 6 = M (since the difference between the amount she received from her dad and the amount she spent is equal to the amount she received from her mom).

Step 4: Now we have a system of two equations:

   D + M = 7
   D - 6 = M

Step 5: To solve this system, we can add the two equations together:

   2D = 13

Step 6: Solving for D, we get D = 13 / 2 = 6.5.

Step 7: Now we can find M by substituting D back into the first equation:

   M = 7 - D = 7 - 6.5 = 0.5.

Step 8: Finally, to find the difference between the amounts she received from her dad and her mom, we subtract M from D:

   D - M = 6.5 - 0.5 = \boxed{6}.

So, Gwen received \boxed{6} more dollars from her dad than she did from her mom.",The answer is 3,For Gwen's birthday she received 5 dollars from her dad. Her mom gave her 2 more dollars. If she spent 6 dollars. How much more money did she receive from her dad than she did from her mom?
answer: Final length = 34 - Growth,2,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how much Robin's hair grew by subtracting the initial length from the final length after growth.

Growth = Initial length - Final length

Step 2: Next, let's find out how much hair Robin cut off.

Cut off = Amount cut

Step 3: Now, let's find out the final length of Robin's hair after growth and cutting. To do this, we'll add the growth to the initial length and then subtract the amount cut.

Final length = Initial length + Growth - Cut off

Step 4: Plug in the given values:

Initial length = 14 inches
Growth = 14 - Final length
Cut off = 20 inches

Step 5: Rearrange the equation to solve for the final length:

Final length + 14 - Growth = 20
Final length = 20 + 14 - Growth

Step 6: Since we don't have the growth value, we can't find the exact final length of Robin's hair. However, we can express the final length in terms of the growth:

Final length = 34 - Growth

\boxed{answer: Final length = 34 - Growth}",The answer is 2,Robin's hair was 14 inches long. It grew by 8 inches. Then he cut off 20 inches. How long is his hair now?

Step 4: Subtract the quantities of cakes that were sold from the total quantity of cakes.
- Remaining cakes: 14 - 97 = \boxed{-83}

Step 5: Since the number of cakes sold is negative, it means that Baker sold more pastries than cakes. However, the question asks for the difference in the number of cakes sold, not the number of pastries. Since the number of pastries sold is 0, the difference in the number of cakes sold is the absolute value of the negative number of cakes sold.
- Difference in number of cakes sold: |-83| = \boxed{83}

Remaining sweet cookies = 8 - 20 = \boxed{-12}

Step 2: Next, let's find out how many salty cookies Paco had left after eating 34.
Initial salty cookies = 6
Salty cookies eaten = 34
Remaining salty cookies = Initial salty cookies - Salty cookies eaten
Remaining salty cookies = 6 - 34 = \boxed{-28}

Step 3: Since the number of sweet cookies is negative, it means Paco ate more sweet cookies than he had initially. However, our question asks for the difference in the number of salty cookies eaten compared to sweet cookies eaten. Since the number of salty cookies is also negative, we can't compare the absolute values directly. Instead, we'll take the absolute values of both numbers and compare them.

Step 4: Absolute value of remaining sweet cookies = |-12| = 12
Absolute value of remaining salty cookies = |-28| = 28

Step 5: Finally, let's find the difference between the absolute values of the remaining sweet and salty cookies.
Difference = Absolute value of remaining sweet cookies - Absolute value of remaining salty cookies
Difference = 12 - 28 = \boxed{-16}

So, Paco ate \boxed{-16} more salty cookies than sweet cookies. However, since the number is negative, it means he actually ate fewer salty cookies than sweet cookies. To get the correct answer, we should change the sign: \boxed{16} more sweet cookies than salty cookies were eaten by Paco.",The answer is 14,Paco had 8 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies. He ate 20 sweet cookies and 34 salty cookies. How many more salty cookies than sweet cookies did he eat?

answer: It's not possible to determine the number of peaches Jake has with the given information.,17,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of peaches Jill, Steven, and Jake have as J, S, and Jk respectively.

Step 2: From the problem, we know that:
- Jk = J - 6 (Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven)
- S = J + 18 (Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill)

Step 3: We also know that Jill has 5 peaches, so J = 5.

Step 4: Substitute J into the equations for S and Jk:
- S = 5 + 18 = 23
- Jk = 5 - 6 = -1 (However, it's not possible to have a negative number of peaches, so let's assume there was a mistake in the problem statement.)

Since the problem seems to have an inconsistency, it's best to double-check the given information or ask for clarification. However, if we assume that Jake can have a negative number of peaches, then Jake would have -1 peach. But remember, this is an assumption based on the given information, and it's not clear if it's valid.

Step 1: Let's denote the distance the frog jumped as F.

Step 2: The grasshopper jumped 19 inches, which is 4 inches more than the frog. So, the frog jumped F - 4 inches.

Step 3: The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. So, the frog jumped F + 44 inches more than the mouse.

Step 4: Since the grasshopper jumped 4 inches more than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, we can say that the grasshopper and the mouse jumped the same distance apart from the frog.

Step 5: Let's denote the distance the mouse jumped as M. Since the grasshopper and the mouse jumped the same distance apart from the frog, we can write the equation: F - 4 = M + 44.

Step 6: We have two variables (F and M) and one equation. To solve this system of equations, we can isolate one variable. Let's isolate F:

F = M + 48

Step 7: Now we have the relationship between F and M. Since the problem doesn't provide any specific information about the mouse's jump, we can't find the exact distance the frog jumped. However, we can express the frog's jump in terms of the mouse's jump: F = M + 48.

Revenue from jerseys = Number of jerseys * Price per jersey
Revenue from jerseys = 43 * $ 232
Revenue from jerseys = $ 9,964

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue.
Total revenue = Revenue from t-shirts + Revenue from jerseys
Total revenue = $ 21,644 + $ 9,964
Total revenue = $ 31,608

Step 4: Since we want to find the difference in cost between a jersey and a t-shirt, we need to subtract the revenue from t-shirts from the total revenue.
Difference in cost = Total revenue - Revenue from t-shirts
Difference in cost = $ 31,608 - $ 21,644
Difference in cost = $ 10,064

Step 5: To find the cost of a jersey, we need to divide the difference in cost by the number of jerseys sold.
Cost of a jersey = Difference in cost / Number of jerseys
Cost of a jersey = $ 10,064 / 43
Cost of a jersey = $ 234

Step 6: To find the cost of a t-shirt, we can use the price per t-shirt given in the problem.
Cost of a t-shirt = Price per t-shirt
Cost of a t-shirt = $ 86

The number of apples He has cannot be determined with the given information.,16,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A and the number of apples Jackie has as J.

Step 2: We know that Adam and Jackie together have 7 apples, so A + J = 7.

Step 3: We also know that He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, so He - (A + J) = 9.

Step 4: Now we can solve the system of equations. First, let's isolate A in the first equation: A = 7 - J.

Step 5: Next, substitute A in the second equation: He - (7 - J) = 9.

Step 6: Simplify the equation: He - 7 + J = 9.

Step 7: Now, let's solve for J: J = 9 + 7 - He.

Step 8: Since J represents the number of apples Jackie has, we know that J must be a non-negative integer.

Step 9: Now, let's solve for He: He = 9 + 7 - J.

Step 10: Since J is a non-negative integer, He will be a positive integer greater than 16 (since 9 + 7 is 16).

Step 11: However, since we don't have enough information about the number of apples Adam and Jackie have, we can't determine the exact number of apples He has.

Rebecca has 72 eggs.,22,"

Step 1: To find out how many eggs Rebecca has, we need to find out how many groups she can make with 11 eggs and 2 eggs per group.

Step 2: To do this, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per group.

Step 3: So, we have 11 eggs and 2 eggs per group.

Step 4: 11 divided by 2 equals 5.5. Since we can't have half an egg, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Step 5: So, Rebecca can make 6 groups of 11 eggs, but since each group has 2 eggs, she actually needs 12 eggs for each group.

Step 6: To find out how many eggs Rebecca has in total, we multiply the number of groups by the number of eggs per group.

Total slices = 9 * 10 = 90 slices
Step 3: There are 2 of us.
Step 4: To find out how many slices each of us gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people.
Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people
Slices per person = 90 / 2 = 45

\boxed{answer: Each of us gets 45 slices of pizza.}

This answer is incorrect because there are not enough slices for 2 people. Let's recheck our calculations.

Step 1: We have 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices.
Step 2: To find the total number of slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza.
Total slices = 9 * 10 = 90 slices
Step 3: There are 2 of us.
Step 4: To find out how many slices each of us gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people.
Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people
Slices per person = 90 / 2 = 45

Since there are not enough slices for 2 people, we need to find out how many slices each person gets if we only distribute the available slices.

Step 5: There are 90 slices and 2 of us.
Step 6: To find out how many slices each of us gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people.
Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people
Slices per person = 90 / 2 = 45

However, since there are not enough slices for 2 people, we need to adjust the number of slices each person gets.

Step 1: List the number of pastries and cakes made by the baker.
Pastries = 52
Cakes = 84

Step 2: List the number of pastries and cakes sold.
Pastries sold = 94
Cakes sold = 102

Step 3: Subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of pastries made to find the number of unsold pastries.
Unsold pastries = Pastries made - Pastries sold
Unsold pastries = 52 - 94 = -42

Since the number of pastries sold is greater than the number of pastries made, there is a mistake in the problem. The number of unsold pastries cannot be negative.

Step 4: Subtract the number of cakes made from the number of cakes sold to find the number of unsold cakes.
Unsold cakes = Cakes sold - Cakes made
Unsold cakes = 102 - 84 = 18

Step 5: Find the difference between the number of unsold cakes and unsold pastries to find the difference in the number of cakes and pastries made.
Difference = Unsold cakes - Unsold pastries
Difference = 18 - (-42) = 60

Since the number of unsold pastries was a mistake, we cannot compare the number of unsold cakes and pastries directly. However, we can compare the number of cakes made and the number of cakes sold, which is the same as the number of pastries sold minus the number of pastries made.

Step 6: Subtract the number of pastries made from the number of pastries sold to find the difference in the number of cakes and pastries made.
Difference = Pastries sold - Pastries made
Difference = 94 - 52 = 42

Step 7: Since the number of cakes made is 84, the number of cakes made minus the number of cakes sold is the same as the difference in the number of cakes and pastries made.
Difference = 84 - 102 = -18

Since the number of cakes made is less than the number of cakes sold, there is a mistake in the problem. The number of cakes made cannot be less than the number of cakes sold.

In conclusion, there is a mistake in the problem, and it is not possible to determine the difference in the number of cakes and pastries made. However, if we assume that the number of cakes made is the same as the number of cakes sold, then the difference in the number of cakes and pastries made would be 42 (Pastries sold - Pastries made).

Mary doesn't need to add any more cups of sugar than cups of salt.,2,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many cups of sugar Mary has already added. Since the recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and she has already put in 0 cups of sugar, we can calculate the amount of sugar she has added so far.

Sugar added so far = Recipe amount - Remaining amount
Sugar added so far = 11 - 0 = \boxed{11} cups

Step 2: Next, let's find out how many cups of salt Mary has already added. She has already put in 12 cups of flour, but the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour. Since 1 cup of flour is equivalent to 1/6 cup of salt (because 6 cups of flour make 1 cup of salt), we can calculate the amount of salt she has already added.

Salt added so far = Flour added / Flour per cup of salt
Salt added so far = 12 / 6 = \boxed{2} cups

Step 3: Now, let's find out how many cups of sugar she needs to add to have the same amount of sugar as salt. Since she has already added 11 cups of sugar and needs to have the same amount as the 2 cups of salt she has already added, we can calculate the number of cups of sugar she needs to add.

Cups of sugar needed = Cups of salt - Cups of sugar added so far
Cups of sugar needed = 2 - 11 = \boxed{-9}

However, since it's not possible to have a negative number of cups of sugar, it means that Mary doesn't need to add any more cups of sugar than cups of salt at this point. She has already added more cups of sugar than the recipe calls for.

Final answer: \boxed{Mary doesn't need to add any more cups of sugar than cups of salt.}",The answer is 2,Mary is baking a cake.

Step 1: First, let's find out how many Ace cards Nell gave to Jeff. To do this, we'll subtract the number of Ace cards she has now from the original number of Ace cards she had.

Ace cards given to Jeff = Original Ace cards - Current Ace cards
= 38 - 376
= -338 (This is a negative number, which means Nell didn't give any Ace cards to Jeff.)

Since the number of Ace cards Nell gave to Jeff is negative, it means that Jeff actually gave some Ace cards to Nell.

Step 2: Now, let's find out how many baseball cards Nell gave to Jeff. To do this, we'll subtract the number of baseball cards she has now from the original number of baseball cards she had.

Baseball cards given to Jeff = Original baseball cards - Current baseball cards

Number of groups of oranges = Total number of oranges / Number of oranges per group
Number of groups of oranges = 384 / 16
Number of groups of oranges = \boxed{24}

Step 3: Since the total number of fruits is the sum of the number of oranges and bananas, and the total number of fruits is also equal to the sum of the number of groups of oranges and bananas, we can find the number of groups of bananas.
Number of groups of bananas = Total fruits - Number of groups of oranges
Number of groups of bananas = 576 - 24
Number of groups of bananas = \boxed{552}

Step 4: Since each group of bananas contains 192 bananas, we can find the number of bananas in one group of bananas.
Number of bananas per group of bananas = Total bananas / Number of groups of bananas
Number of bananas per group of bananas = 192 / 552
Number of bananas per group of bananas ≈ 0.348

Step 1: Find the number of students in each class.
Total students = 120
Number of classrooms = 24

Students per class = Total students / Number of classrooms
Students per class = 120 / 24
Students per class = \boxed{5}

Step 2: Find the number of students that can fit on one bus.
Total seats on all buses = 84 * Number of buses (unknown)
Total students = 120

Students per bus = Total students / Total seats on all buses
Students per bus = 120 / (84 * Number of buses)

Step 3: Solve for the number of buses needed.
Let x be the number of buses.

Students per bus = 120 / (84 * x)

Cross-multiply:
120 * x = 84 * Students per bus

Divide both sides by 84:
x = (120 * x) / 84
x = (5 * Students per bus)

Since we know Students per class = Students per bus, we can substitute:
x = (5 * Students per class)

Substitute the value of Students per class from Step 1:
x = (5 * 5)
x = 25

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number:
x = 26

However, since there are only 84 seats on each bus, we cannot fit 26 classes on one bus. We need to find the largest number of classes that can fit on one bus.

Total seats on one bus = 84
Total students in one class = 5

Step 4: Now we have two equations with two variables:

   A + J = 6
   A = A + J + 4

Step 5: To solve this system of equations, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

   A = A + J + 4 => A - A - J = 4 => -J = 4

Step 6: Solving for J, we get J = -4. But since the number of apples cannot be negative, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's reconsider the problem.

Step 7: The problem states that Adam has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together. This means that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, not than the sum of their apples. So, A = J + 4.

answer: Matthew gave 7 crackers to each of his 3 friends.,7,"

Step 1: Let x be the number of crackers Matthew gave to each friend.

Step 2: The total number of crackers given to the friends is 3x (since there are 3 friends).

Step 3: The total number of crackers Matthew had minus the number of crackers he gave to his friends is the number of crackers he has left. So, 24 - 3x = 17.

Step 4: Solve for x:

   - 3x = 24 - 17
   - 3x = 7
   - x = 7 / 3

Step 5: Since we cannot divide by a fraction, we need to find a common multiple of 3 that is greater than 7. The least common multiple of 3 and 1 (since 7 is a prime number) is 3. So, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

   - 3 * x = 7 * 3
   - 3x = 21
   - x = 21 / 3

Step 6: x = 7, but since we multiplied both sides by 3, we need to divide our answer by 3:

Step 1: Let's denote the number of apps Dave initially had as A, the number of new apps as N, and the number of apps he deleted as D.

Step 2: We are given that A + N = 10 + 11 = 21 and A - D = 4.

Step 3: Now we have a system of two equations:

1) A + N = 21
2) A - D = 4

Step 4: To solve this system, we can first add the two equations together to eliminate A:

(A + N) + (A - D) = 21 + 4
2A = 25
A = 25 / 2 = \boxed{12.5}

Step 5: However, since the number of apps must be a whole number, we know that our initial assumption (A = 12.5) is incorrect. Let's reconsider our initial equation A + N = 21. Since A must be a whole number, N must be less than 10 for A + N to be less than or equal to 21.

Step 6: Let's try N = 9. In this case, A = 21 - 9 = 12. This gives us a whole number for the initial number of apps.

Step 1: Let's denote the number of apps Dave initially had as A, the number of new apps he added as N, and the number of apps he deleted as D.

Step 2: We know that A + N = 21 + 89 = 110 (total apps after adding new ones)
Step 3: We also know that A - D = 24 (remaining apps after deleting some)

Step 4: To find the number of apps Dave deleted, we can rewrite the second equation as D = A - 24.

Step 5: Now, we can find the difference between the total number of apps after adding new ones and the number of apps Dave initially had, which is the number of apps he added.

Step 6: So, N = (110 - A)

Step 7: Since we know that A - D = 24, we can substitute A with (24 + D) in the equation for N.

Step 8: N = (110 - (24 + D))

Step 9: To solve for D, we can rewrite the equation for A - D as D = A - 24.

Step 10: Substitute A with (24 + D) in the equation for D.

Step 11: D = (24 + D) - 24

Step 12: Simplify the equation to D = D.

Step 13: Since the equation D = D is always true, we can't find a unique value for D. However, we can find the difference between the number of apps he added and the number of apps he deleted by subtracting the initial number of apps from the total number of apps after adding new ones.

Step 14: N - D = 110 - 24 = 86

So, the final answer is \boxed{86}. Dave added 86 more apps than he deleted.",The answer is 3,Dave had 21 apps on his phone. He added 89 new apps. After deleting some he had 24 left. How many more apps did he add than he deleted?

Step 2: Since the number of alligators hiding is negative, it means that there were more alligators not hiding than the ones that were hiding.

Step 3: To find the number of alligators not hiding, we need to subtract the number of alligators hiding from the total number of alligators at the zoo.
- Total alligators = 75 (initial alligators)
- Alligators not hiding = Total alligators - Alligators hiding = 75 + 56 = \boxed{131}

So, \boxed{131} alligators were not hiding.",The answer is 56,"At the zoo, a cage had 3 snakes and 75 alligators. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding How many alligators were not hiding?"
60,220,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many flower beds they have.
Number of flower beds = Total seeds / Seeds per flower bed
= 55 seeds / 15 seeds per flower bed
= \boxed{3.67} flower beds

Step 2: Since they can't have a fraction of a flower bed, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.
So, they have 4 flower beds.

Step 3: Now, let's find out how many flowers grew in each flower bed.
Flowers per flower bed = Total seeds that grew / Number of flower beds
= 60 seeds / 4 flower beds
= \boxed{15} flowers

Step 4: Finally, to find the total number of flowers they grew, we'll multiply the number of flowers per flower bed by the number of flower beds.
Total flowers = Flowers per flower bed * Number of flower beds
= 15 flowers * 4 flower beds
= \boxed{60} flowers

So, they grew \boxed{60} flowers.",The answer is 220,Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?
3 cups,3,"

Step 1: Identify the total amount of sugar needed.
Total sugar needed = 7 cups

Step 2: Identify the amount of sugar already added.
Sugar already added = 4 cups

Step 3: Subtract the amount already added from the total amount needed.
Remaining sugar needed = Total sugar needed - Sugar already added
Remaining sugar needed = 7 cups - 4 cups
Remaining sugar needed = \boxed{3 cups}

So, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe.",The answer is 3,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add?
13 inches,11,"

Step 1: Let's denote the distance the frog jumped as F.
The grasshopper jumped 13 inches.

Step 2: The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump is 13 + 2 = \boxed{15 inches}.

Step 3: Since the grasshopper jumped 15 inches and the frog jumped a distance that is 2 inches less, the frog jumped F = 15 - 2 = \boxed{13 inches}.

Final answer: \boxed{13 inches}",The answer is 11,The grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper. How far did the frog jump?
