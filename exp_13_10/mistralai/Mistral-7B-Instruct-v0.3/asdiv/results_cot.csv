"1 quarter, 1 dime, and 7 pennies",4,"

Step 1: We know that the coins we have are quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents), and pennies (1 cent).

Step 2: To minimize the number of coins, we should use the highest denomination coins first.

Step 3: Since 28 cents is not a multiple of 25, we cannot use only quarters. So, let's use the maximum number of quarters we can, which is 1 (25 cents).

Step 4: Now, we have 3 cents left (28 - 25 = 3). Since we cannot use quarters anymore, we will use dimes. But we cannot use a whole dime because it's worth more than the remaining cents. So, we will use one dime and some pennies to make up the remaining 3 cents.

Step 5: The maximum number of dimes we can use is 1 (10 cents), leaving us with 3 - 10 = -7 cents. However, we cannot have negative coins, so we will use pennies instead.

Step 6: To make up for the negative 7 cents, we will use 7 pennies.

"answer: There is a mistake in the problem statement, and it is impossible to determine the number of nails they will have based on the given information.",95,"

Step 1: Calculate the total number of nails in the boxes that Charlie bought.
Total nails in boxes = Boxes of big nails * Nails per big box + Boxes of small nails * Nails per small box
Total nails in boxes = 2 * 55 + 0 * 31 = 110 nails

Step 2: Subtract the nails that Charlie bought from the total number of nails they had initially.
Remaining nails = Initial nails - Nails bought
Remaining nails = 9 - 110 = -101

Since the number of nails cannot be negative, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. Let's assume that Charlie bought only one box of each size to avoid a negative number of nails.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of nails in one box of each size.
Total nails in one set of boxes = Boxes of big nails * Nails per big box + Boxes of small nails * Nails per small box
Total nails in one set of boxes = 1 * 55 + 1 * 31 = 86 nails

Step 4: Subtract the nails that Charlie bought from the initial number of nails.
Remaining nails = Initial nails - Nails bought
Remaining nails = 9 - 86 = -77

Since the number of nails cannot be negative, there is still a mistake in the problem statement. Let's assume that Charlie bought only one box of the big nails and no small nails to avoid a negative number of nails.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of nails in one box of the big nails.
Total nails in one big box = Nails per big box
Total nails in one big box = 55 nails

Step 6: Subtract the nails that Charlie bought from the initial number of nails.
Remaining nails = Initial nails - Nails bought
Remaining nails = 9 - 55 = -46

Since the number of nails cannot be negative, there is still a mistake in the problem statement. Let's assume that Charlie bought no nails to avoid a negative number of nails.

Step 7: Calculate the total number of nails they had initially.
Initial nails = Remaining nails
Initial nails = 9 nails

In conclusion, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement, and it is impossible to determine the number of nails they will have based on the given information.

Step 1: Let's denote the height of the Space Needle as S.

Step 2: Since the CN Tower is taller than the Space Needle by 369 m, we can write the equation:

CN Tower height = Space Needle height + 369 m

Step 3: We know that the CN Tower stands at 553 m high, so we can substitute the given values into the equation:

553 m = S + 369 m

Step 4: To isolate S, we subtract 369 m from both sides of the equation:

553 m - 369 m = S

Step 5: Simplify the equation:

184 m = S

Step 6: Finally, we have the height of the Space Needle:

\boxed{answer = 184 m}",The answer is 184,"Lastly, Rob compared Canada's CN Tower and Seattle's Space Needle. How tall is the Space Needle if the CN Tower stands at 553 m high and it is taller than the Space Needle by 369 m?"

Step 1: Identify the given information.
- The exit door leads to a river that is 487 inches wide.
- The bridge he needs to cross is 295 inches wide.

Step 2: Determine the difference between the river width and the bridge width.
Difference = River width - Bridge width
Difference = 487 inches - 295 inches
Difference = \boxed{192 inches}

Step 3: Since the question asks for the length he needs to build, we need to find the length of the river that is not covered by the bridge.
Uncovered river length = River width - Bridge width
Uncovered river length = 487 inches - 295 inches
Uncovered river length = \boxed{192 inches}

Step 4: To find out how much longer he needs to build, we need to find the ratio of the uncovered river length to the bridge length.
Ratio = Uncovered river length / Bridge length
Ratio = 192 inches / 295 inches

Step 5: Simplify the ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 6.
Simplified Ratio = (192 / 6) / (295 / 6)
Simplified Ratio = 32 / 49

Step 6: To find out how much longer he needs to build, we need to find the difference between the total river length and the bridge length multiplied by the simplified ratio.
Length to build = (Total river length - Bridge length) * Simplified Ratio
Length to build = (487 inches - 295 inches) * (32 / 49)
Length to build = (192 inches) * (32 / 49)
Length to build = \boxed{128 inches}

Total cement = 215 lbs + 137 lbs = \boxed{352 lbs}

Step 2: Now, we know that the total amount of cement is 450 lbs. Let's find out how much cement the father had originally.

Total cement = Father's cement + Son's cement
450 lbs = Father's cement + 137 lbs

Step 3: To find out how much cement the father had originally, we subtract the son's cement from the total cement.

Father's cement = Total cement - Son's cement
Father's cement = 450 lbs - 137 lbs = \boxed{313 lbs}

So, the father originally had 313 lbs of cement.",The answer is 98,"He wanted to make sure that he is protected from the cold evenings in the forest so he decided to build a fireplace made of cement. If he bought 215 lbs of cement and his son brought another 137 lbs, how much cement did he have originally if he now has 450 lbs?"
answer: He is 1 gallon short.,11,"

Step 1: Add the amount of paint he already has to the amount he bought.
Total paint = 36 gallons + 23 gallons

Step 2: Compare the total amount of paint to the amount he needs.

Total paint - Amount needed = 69 gallons

Since he needs 70 gallons, he is 1 gallon short.

\boxed{answer: He is 1 gallon short.}",The answer is 11,"For finishing touches, he needed 70 gallons of paint. If he bought 23 gallons to add to his existing 36 gallons of paint, how much more paint will he need?"
657 pounds,735,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how much garbage the second group collected. Since the second group gathered 39 pounds less than Lizzie's group, we can subtract 39 pounds from the amount Lizzie's group collected.

387 pounds (Lizzie's group) - 39 pounds (less than Lizzie's group) = \boxed{348 pounds}

Step 2: Now, we know that Lizzie's group collected 348 pounds and the other group collected 348 - 39 = 309 pounds.

Step 3: To find the total amount of garbage both groups collected, we simply add the amounts collected by each group.

348 pounds (Lizzie's group) + 309 pounds (other group) = \boxed{657 pounds}

So, the two groups were able to gather a total of \boxed{657 pounds} of garbage.",The answer is 735,"Lizzie lives in a very big and polluted city. Being an advocate for the environment, she organized a cleanup drive to help reduce the pollution. They started by cleaning the rivers that flow through and around the city. If her group was able to collect 387 pounds of garbage and another group gathered 39 pounds less than Lizzie's group, how much garbage were the two groups able to gather?"
385 square feet,385,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how much land has been cleaned by both groups.
   Cleaned land = Lizzie's group + Other group
   Cleaned land = 250 square feet + 265 square feet
   Cleaned land = \boxed{515 square feet}

Step 2: Now, let's find out how much land remains to be cleaned.
   Remaining land = Total land - Cleaned land
   Remaining land = 900 square feet - 515 square feet
   Remaining land = \boxed{385 square feet}

So, there are \boxed{385 square feet} of land remaining to be cleaned.",The answer is 385,"After the cleaning the rivers they went on to tidy up the farmlands. If Lizzie's group covered 250 square feet of land and the other group covered 265, how many more square feet of land remains to be cleaned if there is total of 900 square feet of land?"
25,25,"

Step 1: Add the number of houses covered by both groups.
238 + 190 = \boxed{428}

Step 2: Compare the total number of houses in the city with the number of houses covered by both groups.
453 - 428 = \boxed{25}

So, there are 25 houses remaining for the two groups to collect garbage from.",The answer is 25,"The two groups will also collect garbage from all the 453 houses in the city. If Lizzie's group covered 238 houses while the other group covered 190, how many more houses remain?"
91,91,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of people in the other group as x.

Step 2: We know that Lizzie's group has 54 people, so Lizzie's group has 54 - x members more than the other group.

Step 3: The problem states that Lizzie's group has 17 more members than the other group, so we can write the equation: 54 - x = 17 + x

Step 4: Combining the terms with x gives us the equation: 2x = 54 - 17

Step 5: Solving for x, we get: x = (54 - 17) / 2 = 37

Step 6: So, there are 37 people in the other group.

Step 7: To find the total number of people working together, we add the number of people in both groups: 54 (Lizzie's group) + 37 (other group) = 91

Final answer: \boxed{91} people are working together to clean the city.",The answer is 91,"If Lizzie's group is composed of 54 people and they have 17 more members than the other group, how many people are working together to clean the city?"
52,48,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many factories have been checked by both groups.

Total factories checked = Group 1 factories + Group 2 factories - Common factories

Step 2: To find the common factories, we need to find the minimum of the two groups' counts.

Common factories = min(Group 1 factories, Group 2 factories)

Step 3: Now, we can find the common factories.

Common factories = min(69, 52) = 52

Step 4: Subtract the common factories from the total factories checked by both groups.

Total factories checked = 169 - 52 = \boxed{117}

Step 5: Since there are 169 factories in total, the remaining unchecked factories are the total factories minus the factories checked.

Remaining unchecked factories = Total factories - Total factories checked

Step 6: Plug in the values.

Remaining unchecked factories = 169 - 117 = \boxed{52}

So, there are 52 factories remaining unchecked.",The answer is 48,"Finally, they had to roam around 169 factories to make sure they are throwing their wastes properly. If their group went to 69 factories and the second went to 52, how many factories remain unchecked?"
answer: 45,45,"

Step 1: We know that Kevin's sister prepared 25 mini cupcakes and his mother prepared 30.

Step 2: To find out how many cupcakes his grandmother prepared, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes prepared by Kevin's sister and mother from the total number of cupcakes.

Step 3: Let's denote the number of cupcakes his grandmother prepared as G.

Step 4: We have the following equation:
Total cupcakes = Cupcakes by sister + Cupcakes by mother + Cupcakes by grandmother
100 = 25 + 30 + G

Step 5: Now, let's solve for G:
G = 100 - 25 - 30
G = 45

Step 6: So, his grandmother prepared 45 mini cupcakes for the party.

182 grams,182,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how much chips they have prepared together so far.

Total chips prepared = Chips prepared by him + Chips prepared by his father
Total chips prepared = 350 grams + 268 grams = \boxed{618 grams}

Step 2: Now, let's find out how many more grams of chips are needed to reach 800 grams.

Chips needed = Target chips - Total chips prepared
Chips needed = 800 grams - 618 grams = \boxed{182 grams}

Step 3: Finally, let's assume that his brother will prepare the remaining chips.

Chips for his brother = Chips needed
Chips for his brother = 182 grams

So, his brother should prepare \boxed{182 grams} of chips.",The answer is 182,"They also prepared some chips. If he prepared 350 grams of chips and his father prepared 268 grams, how much chips should his brother prepare if they are to have 800 grams of chips?"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many slices of pizza the family has in total.

Family slices = Sister's slices + Brother's slices
Family slices = 48 + 48 = \boxed{96}

Step 2: Next, we need to subtract the number of slices the family already ate.

Remaining slices = Family slices - Eaten slices
Remaining slices = 96 - 27 = \boxed{69}

Step 3: Since the question asks for the number of slices for their neighbors, we can assume that the family will not eat any more pizza. Therefore, the remaining slices are the number of slices for their neighbors.

Slices for neighbors = Remaining slices
Slices for neighbors = \boxed{69}

So, the family has \boxed{69} slices of pizza for their neighbors.",The answer is 69,"Since pizza is a favorite in Kevin's family, they also bought some. His sister bought 48 slices of pizza and his brother bought 48 as well. How many slices of pizza do they have for their neighbors if the family already ate 27 slices?"
answer: x = \frac{25,125,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of hotdogs brought by the first neighbor as x.
Step 2: The second neighbor brought 25 less hotdogs than the first one, so the number of hotdogs brought by the second neighbor is x - 25.
Step 3: To find the total number of hotdogs brought by both neighbors, we add the number of hotdogs brought by each neighbor: x + (x - 25)
Step 4: Simplify the equation: x + x - 25
Step 5: Combine like terms: 2x - 25
Step 6: The question asks for the total number of hotdogs, so our final answer is the value of x:

\boxed{answer: x = \frac{25}{2}}

Since we don't know the exact number of hotdogs brought by the first neighbor, we can only provide the equation for x. To find the exact number of hotdogs brought by the first neighbor, you would need additional information.

Insects: \boxed{253}
Birds: \boxed{143}

Step 2: Now, let's find the total number of species she saw in the country.
Total species: Insects + Birds = 253 + 143 = \boxed{396}

Step 3: Since we know the total number of species and the number of insect and bird species she saw, we can find the number of reptile species by subtracting the number of insect and bird species from the total number of species.
Reptiles: Total species - Insects - Birds = 396 - 253 - 143 = \boxed{100}

So, she saw \boxed{100} reptile species in the country.",The answer is 136,"Next, she went to a country full of mountains. There she saw 532 species of insects, reptiles and birds. If she saw 253 insect species and 143 bird species, how many reptile species did she see?"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many red and green shells she has.
Red shells = 76
Green shells = 49

Step 2: Now, let's find out the total number of shells she collected.
Total shells = Red shells + Green shells
Total shells = 76 + 49
Total shells = \boxed{125}

Step 3: Since she collected a total of 291 seashells, the number of shells that are not red or green is the difference between the total number of shells and the number of red and green shells.
Shells not red or green = Total shells - (Red shells + Green shells)
Shells not red or green = 291 - (76 + 49)
Shells not red or green = 291 - 125
Shells not red or green = \boxed{166}

Step 1: Let's denote the amount of money spent on t-shirts as T.

Step 2: According to the problem, the amount spent on key chains and bracelets is $146.00 more than the amount spent on t-shirts, so the amount spent on key chains and bracelets is T + 146.

Step 3: The total amount spent on all the souvenirs is the sum of the amounts spent on t-shirts, key chains, and bracelets. So, the total amount spent is T + (T + 146) = 2T + 146.

Step 4: The total amount spent on all the souvenirs is $347.00, so we have the equation 2T + 146 = 347.

Step 5: To find T, we subtract 146 from both sides of the equation: 2T = 347 - 146 => 2T = 201.

Step 6: Finally, to find T, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: T = 201 / 2 => T = 100.5.

Since it's not possible to spend half a dollar, we round T up to the nearest whole number, which is 101.

Step 7: Now that we have the amount spent on t-shirts, we can find the amount spent on key chains and bracelets by adding the difference between the total amount and the amount spent on t-shirts to the amount spent on t-shirts: 347 - 101 = 246.

Step 8: The amount spent on key chains and bracelets is T + 146, so we have 246 = 101 + 146 => 146 = 45.

However, this is a mistake. The correct amount spent on key chains and bracelets is the difference between the total amount and the amount spent on t-shirts, which is 347 - 101 = 246.

Step 9: To find the final answer, we add the amounts spent on t-shirts, key chains, and bracelets: 101 + 246 = \boxed{347}.

Step 1: Let's denote the amount donated to Animal Preservation Park as A.

Step 2: Since The Forest Reserve received $140.00 more than Animal Preservation Park, the amount donated to The Forest Reserve is A + 140.

Step 3: The third park, which we'll call Park C, received the remaining amount. So, the total donation is the sum of the donations to the three parks:

A + (A + 140) + Park C = Total Donation

Step 4: Simplify the equation:

2A + 140 + Park C = Total Donation

Step 5: We know the donation to Treetown National Park, which is $570.00. So, we can set up another equation:

A + (A + 140) + 570 = Total Donation

Step 6: Solve the second equation for Park C:

Park C = Total Donation - 2A - 140

Step 7: Now, substitute the value of Park C from the second equation into the first equation:

2A + 140 + (Total Donation - 2A - 140) = 570

Step 8: Simplify the equation:

Total Donation = 570 + 2A

Step 9: Now, we have two equations with two variables:

1) 2A + 140 + Park C = Total Donation
2) Total Donation = 570 + 2A

Step 10: Solve the first equation for Park C:

Park C = Total Donation - 2A - 140

Step 11: Substitute the expression for Total Donation from the second equation into the equation for Park C:

Park C = (570 + 2A) - 2A - 140

Step 12: Simplify the equation:

Park C = 556

Step 13: Now, we have the donation for Park C. To find the total donation, we can use the second equation:

Total Donation = 570 + 2A

Step 14: Since we know the donation to Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve, we can find A:

A + (A + 140) = 570
2A + 140 = 570
2A = 430
A = 215

Step 1: To find out how many matchboxes each house will receive, we need to divide the total number of matchboxes by the number of houses.

Step 2: In this case, the total number of matchboxes is 119, and the number of houses is 9.

Step 3: So, we divide 119 by 9.

Step 4: 119 ÷ 9 = 13 remainder 4

Step 5: Since we cannot have a remainder when dividing a number of items among a group, we need to adjust the number of matchboxes.

Step 6: To avoid a remainder, we can add the remaining matchboxes (4) to the house that receives the largest number of matchboxes (13).

Step 7: Now, the house with the largest number of matchboxes will receive 13 + 4 = \boxed{17} matchboxes.

Step 8: The remaining houses will receive 119 - 17 = 102 matchboxes.

Step 9: To divide the 102 matchboxes among the 8 houses, we divide 102 by 8.

Step 10: 102 ÷ 8 = 12 remainder 6

Step 11: Again, to avoid a remainder, we add the remaining matchboxes (6) to the house that receives the second largest number of matchboxes (12).

Step 12: Now, the house with the second largest number of matchboxes will receive 12 + 6 = \boxed{18} matchboxes.

Step 13: The remaining houses will receive 102 - 18 = 84 matchboxes.

Step 14: To divide the 84 matchboxes among the 6 houses, we divide 84 by 6.

Step 15: 84 ÷ 6 = 14 remainder 0

Step 16: Now, each of the remaining 6 houses will receive 14 matchboxes.

Step 17: In summary, the house with the largest number of matchboxes will receive \boxed{17} matchboxes, the house with the second largest number of matchboxes will receive \boxed{18} matchboxes, and the remaining 6 houses will receive \boxed{14} matchboxes each.",The answer is 13,"They had 119 matchboxes wrapped in colorful shiny wrappers.

Step 1: Calculate the number of matchboxes per house.
Number of houses = \boxed{9}
Total matchboxes = \boxed{119}

Matchboxes per house = Total matchboxes / Number of houses
Matchboxes per house = 119 / 9
Matchboxes per house = 13.22 (rounded to two decimal places)

Since it is not possible to distribute a fraction of a matchbox, we will round down to the nearest whole number.

Step 2: Calculate the number of matchboxes distributed to the houses.
Number of matchboxes distributed = Number of houses * Matchboxes per house
Number of matchboxes distributed = 9 * 13
Number of matchboxes distributed = 117

Step 3: Calculate the number of matchboxes left.
Number of matchboxes left = Total matchboxes - Number of matchboxes distributed

23.56,24,"∴ Perimeter = \boxed{answer} ft.

Solution:

1. First, let's find the number of sides of the regular octagon. Since it's regular, all its angles are equal. An octagon has 8 sides and 8 angles.

2. The sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon with n sides is (n-2) * 180 degrees. For an octagon, this would be (8-2) * 180 = 12 * 180 = 2160 degrees.

3. Since all the angles are equal, each angle is 2160 / 8 = 270 degrees.

4. Now, let's find the measure of each exterior angle. The sum of the interior and exterior angles of a polygon is always 360 degrees. So, the measure of each exterior angle is 360 - 270 = 90 degrees.

5. The measure of each exterior angle is also the central angle subtended by each side at the center of the polygon.

6. In a circle, the arc length is proportional to the central angle. If the length of one side of the octagon is 3 ft, then the length of the arc subtended by that side at the center of the circle is proportional to 3 ft * (90/360) = 0.25 * 3 = 0.75 ft.

7. Since there are 8 sides, the total length of the arc around the circle is 8 * 0.75 = 6 ft.

8. The diameter of the circle is the length of the arc plus the distance between the center of the circle and any point on the circle. Since the octagon is inscribed in the circle, the distance between the center of the circle and any point on the circle is half the length of a side, which is 3 ft / 2 = 1.5 ft.

9. The diameter of the circle is the sum of the length of the arc and the distance between the center of the circle and any point on the circle, which is 6 ft + 1.5 ft = 7.5 ft.

10. The circumference of the circle is the length of the diameter multiplied by π (approximately 3.14159). So, the circumference is 7.5 ft * π ≈ 23.56 ft.

11. The perimeter of the octagon is the length of the circumference of the circle. Since the octagon is inscribed in the circle, the perimeter is approximately 23.56 ft.

Solution:
1. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of cupcakes and the number of children. The GCD is the largest number that can evenly divide both numbers.
2. To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:
   a. Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.
   b. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.
   c. Repeat steps a and b until the remainder is 0. The GCD is the last non-zero number.
3. Let's apply the Euclidean algorithm to 17 (cupcakes) and 3 (children):
   a. 17 divided by 3 equals 5 with a remainder of 2.
   b. 3 is the new smaller number, and 17 is the new larger number (remainder).
   c. 17 divided by 3 equals 5 with a remainder of 2.
   d. 3 is the new smaller number, and 2 is the new larger number (remainder).
   e. 3 divided by 2 equals 1 with a remainder of 1.
   f. Since the remainder is 1, the GCD is 1.

answer: There will be no seats with 3 children seated on them.,5,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many groups of 2 children can sit on a seat.

Number of groups of 2 = Total children / Seats per group
                                 = 19 / 2
                                 = 9.5

Since we cannot have half a group, we round down to 9 groups of 2 children.

Step 2: Now, let's find out how many children are left after seating 9 groups of 2 children.

Children left = Total children - (Number of groups of 2 * Seats per group)
                      = 19 - (9 * 2)
                      = 19 - 18
                      = 1

Step 3: Since there is 1 child left, and each seat can hold 2 or 3 children, we will seat this child with 2 other children on a seat.

Seats with 3 children = Number of remaining children / Seats per group (3)
                                    = 1 / 3
                                    = 0.3333... (rounded down to 0 since we cannot have a fraction of a seat)

Step 1: First, we need to find out how many pencils are given to each classroom. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of classrooms.

Pencils per classroom = Total pencils / Number of classrooms
= 935 pencils / 9 classrooms
= 104 pencils per classroom

Step 2: Now, we know that each classroom receives 104 pencils. To find out how many pencils are left for the library, we subtract the number of pencils given to the classrooms from the total number of pencils.

Pencils for the library = Total pencils - Pencils for classrooms
= 935 pencils - (9 classrooms * 104 pencils per classroom)
= 935 pencils - 942 pencils

Step 3: Since we have a negative result, it means that there are not enough pencils for all the classrooms. In this case, there are actually 7 fewer pencils than needed for the classrooms. So, we subtract 7 from the total number of pencils to find out how many pencils are left for the library.

Pencils for the library = Total pencils - (942 pencils - 7 pencils)
= 935 pencils - 935 pencils + 7 pencils
= 7 pencils

Step 1: Determine the total number of people that can be accommodated in a large room (3 people).
Total people in a large room = 3

Step 2: Determine the total number of people in the tourist group.
Total people in the group = 26

Step 3: Calculate the number of large rooms needed to accommodate the entire group without any leftover people.
Number of large rooms = Total people in the group / People per large room
Number of large rooms = 26 / 3
Number of large rooms = \boxed{8.67}

Since we cannot rent a fraction of a room, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Step 1: Determine the number of people that can be accommodated in a large room.
Since a large room can accommodate 3 people, we can divide the total number of people by 3.

Step 2: Determine the number of large rooms needed.
Let x be the number of large rooms needed.
So, the number of people in large rooms = x * 3

Step 3: Determine the number of people left to be accommodated in small rooms.
The total number of people is 26. So, the number of people in large rooms = 26 - number of small rooms

Step 4: Equate the number of people in large rooms with the number of people that can be accommodated in large rooms.
(x * 3) = 26 - number of small rooms

Step 5: Solve for the number of small rooms.
Rearrange the equation to solve for the number of small rooms:
number of small rooms = 26 - (x * 3)

Step 6: Find the least number of small rooms.
Since we want to minimize the number of small rooms, we should maximize the number of large rooms (x).
To do this, we'll find the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 26.
The largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 26 is 8 (since 8 * 3 = 24).
So, x = 8.

Step 7: Calculate the number of small rooms.
number of small rooms = 26 - (8 * 3)
number of small rooms = 26 - 24
number of small rooms = 2

Final answer: \boxed{2} small rooms should be rented.",The answer is 1,"A tourist group has 26 people.

12 large groups and 2 small groups,12,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many large groups are needed to accommodate the 7-member groups.

Step 2: We can do this by dividing the total number of members by the number of members in each large group.

Step 3: 90 members / 7 members per large group = \boxed{12.857142857142857}

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Step 4: Rounding down, we get 12 large groups.

Step 5: Now, let's find out how many members are left after forming the large groups.

Step 6: 90 members - (12 large groups * 7 members per large group) = 90 - (84) = 6 members.

Step 7: Since each small group has 3 members, we can form 2 small groups with the remaining members.

Step 8: In total, we have formed 12 large groups and 2 small groups.

Final answer: \boxed{12 large groups and 2 small groups}",The answer is 12,"A ballet class wants to divide its 90 members into some large groups at 7 members each and some small groups at 3 members each. In order to make the least number of groups, how many large groups should be made?"
answer: 1 small group should be made,2,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many large groups are needed. We can do this by dividing the total number of members by the number of members in each large group.

Large groups = Total members / Members per large group
= 90 / 7
= 13 (with a remainder of 0)

So, 13 large groups are needed.

Step 2: Now, let's find out how many small groups are needed. We know that there are 90 - (13 * 7) = 90 - 91 = -1 members left. Since it's not possible to have a negative number of groups, we need to adjust the number of large groups to make room for the small groups.

Let x be the number of small groups. Then, the number of large groups will be 13 - x.

The total number of members in large groups will be (13 - x) * 7. The total number of members in small groups will be x * 3. The total number of members should still be 90.

(13 - x) * 7 + x * 3 = 90
91 - 7x + 3x = 90
-4x = -1
x = 1/4

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, x = 1.

Step 1: Let's denote the weight of a diamond as D and the weight of a jade as J.

Step 2: We know that the weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g, so D = 100 / 5 = \boxed{20 g}.

Step 3: We also know that the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. Since the weight of 4 diamonds is 4 * D = 4 * 20 = 80 g, the weight of the 2 jades must be 140 - 80 = \boxed{60 g}.

Step 4: To find the difference in weight between a jade and a diamond, we subtract the weight of a diamond from the weight of a jade: J - D = 60 - 20 = \boxed{40 g}.

So, a jade is 40 g heavier than a diamond.",The answer is 10,The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?

Step 1: Let's denote the weight of a single bed as S and the weight of a double bed as D.

Step 2: We know that the weight of 5 single beds is 50 kg, so 5S = 50 kg.

Step 3: We also know that the total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg. So, (2S + 4D) = 100 kg.

Step 4: Now, we have two equations with two variables:

   1) 5S = 50
   2) 2S + 4D = 100

Step 5: Solve the first equation for S: S = 10 kg (since 50 / 5 = 10).

Step 6: Substitute S = 10 into the second equation: 2(10) + 4D = 100.

Step 7: Simplify the equation: 20 + 4D = 100.

Step 8: Solve for D: D = (100 - 20) / 4 = 22.5 kg.

Step 9: Now, we can find the difference between the weights of a double bed and a single bed: D - S = 22.5 kg - 10 kg = \boxed{12.5 kg}.

So, a double bed is 12.5 kg heavier than a single bed.",The answer is 10,The weight of 5 single beds is 50 kg. The total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg. How much heavier is a double bed than a single bed?
"The weight of a glass bottle is heavier than the weight of a plastic bottle, but we cannot determine the exact difference without knowing the weight of 1 plastic bottle.",150,"

Step 1: First, let's find the weight of 4 glass bottles. Since 3 glass bottles weigh 600 g, 1 more glass bottle would weigh 600 g + x, where x is the weight of 1 glass bottle.

Step 2: Now, let's find the weight of 5 plastic bottles. Since we don't have the weight of 1 plastic bottle, we can't find the weight of 5 plastic bottles directly. However, we can find the total weight of all the bottles (glass and plastic) and subtract the weight of the 4 glass bottles we found in step 1.

Step 3: The total weight of all the bottles is 1 kg 50 g. So, the weight of the 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1000 g + 50 g - the weight of the 4 glass bottles.

Step 4: Substitute the weight of the 4 glass bottles from step 1 into the equation from step 3: 1000 g + 50 g - (600 g + 4x) = 0.

Step 5: Solve for x: 940 g + 4x = 1000 g, so x = 60 g.

Step 6: Now, we can find the weight of 1 glass bottle: 600 g + x = 600 g + 60 g = \boxed{660 g}.

Step 7: To find the difference in weight between a glass bottle and a plastic bottle, we don't have the weight of 1 plastic bottle, so we can't find the exact difference. However, we know that the weight of 1 glass bottle is 660 g, and we can assume that the weight of 1 plastic bottle is less than 660 g (since a glass bottle is heavier).

Final answer: \boxed{The weight of a glass bottle is heavier than the weight of a plastic bottle, but we cannot determine the exact difference without knowing the weight of 1 plastic bottle.}",The answer is 150,The weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g.

Step 1: Let's denote the weight of a fox as F and the weight of a dog as D.

Step 2: We know that the weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg, so F * 5 = 25. Solving for F, we get F = 5 kg (the weight of one fox).

Step 3: We also know that the total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg. Since we know the weight of one fox (F = 5 kg), we can find the weight of the 3 foxes as 3 * F = 3 * 5 = 15 kg.

Step 4: The remaining weight should be the weight of the 5 dogs. So, 65 - 15 = 50 kg is the total weight of the 5 dogs.

Step 5: Since we know the weight of one fox (F = 5 kg), we can find the weight of one dog by subtracting the weight of one fox from the total weight of the 5 dogs divided by 5 (since there are 5 dogs). So, D = (50 - 5) / 5 = 9 kg (the weight of one dog).

Step 6: To find the difference in weight between a dog and a fox, we subtract the weight of a fox from the weight of a dog. So, D - F = 9 - 5 = \boxed{4 kg} (A dog is 4 kg heavier than a fox).",The answer is 5,The weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg. The total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg.

1700 g,850,"

Step 1: Convert all weights to grams.
5 kg 200 g = 5000 g + 200 g = 5200 g
5 kg 700 g = 5000 g + 700 g = 5700 g

Step 2: Find the total weight of 4 watermelons.
Total weight of 4 watermelons = 4 * 5200 g = 20800 g

Step 3: Find the total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples.
Total weight of 3 watermelons = 3 * 5200 g = 15600 g
Total weight of 4 pineapples = 4 * 700 g = 2800 g
Total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples = 15600 g + 2800 g = 18400 g

Step 4: Subtract the total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples from the total weight of 4 watermelons to find the weight of one watermelon minus the weight of four pineapples.
Weight of one watermelon minus the weight of four pineapples = 20800 g - 18400 g = 2400 g

Step 5: Since we want to find the difference in weight between a watermelon and a pineapple, we need to find the weight of one pineapple.
Weight of one pineapple = Total weight of 4 pineapples / 4 = 2800 g / 4 = 700 g

Step 6: Subtract the weight of one pineapple from the weight of one watermelon minus the weight of four pineapples.

- The weight of 4 cakes is 800 g.
- The total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 g, which is equal to 1000 g + 100 g = 1100 g.

Step 2: Find the weight of 3 cakes. Since each cake weighs 200 g (800 g / 4), the weight of 3 cakes is 3 * 200 g = \boxed{600 g}.

Step 3: Find the weight of 5 pieces of bread. The total weight is 1100 g, and the weight of 3 cakes is 600 g. So, the weight of 5 pieces of bread is 1100 g - 600 g = \boxed{500 g}.

Step 4: Find the difference in weight between a cake and a piece of bread. Since a cake weighs 200 g and a piece of bread weighs 100 g, the difference is 200 g - 100 g = \boxed{100 g}.

Solution:

1. First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 10, 8, and 12. The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers.

   To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of each number and find the smallest one that appears in all lists:

   Multiples of 10: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, ...
   Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, ...

   The smallest number that appears in all three lists is 40. So, the LCM of 10, 8, and 12 is 40.

2. Now, let's calculate how many bags each person packs in 40 minutes:

   - Tony packs 4 bags (40 minutes / 10 minutes per bag).
   - Sam packs 5 bags (40 minutes / 8 minutes per bag).
   - Sarah packs 3.333... bags (40 minutes / 12 minutes per bag). Since we cannot have a fraction of a bag, we round down to 3 bags for Sarah.

3. In total, they pack 4 + 5 + 3 = \boxed{12} bags in 40 minutes.

4. Since they started packing at 12:55, they will start packing at the same time again when they have packed 12 bags. Let's find the time for the 12th bag:

1. First, let's find out when the next time each clock will chime after 19:43.

   - The first clock chimes every 5 minutes, so it will chime next at 19:48.
   - The second clock chimes every 10 minutes, so it will chime next at 19:53.
   - The third clock chimes every 15 minutes, so it will chime next at 20:00.

2. Since the three clocks chime together at the same time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5, 10, and 15. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the numbers in the set.

   - To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of each number and find the smallest one that is common to all three lists:
     - Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, ...

Step 1: First, let's find the time when the next three buses for the three stops set out together.

Since the buses from stop A to stop B set out every 20 minutes, the next bus after 2:45 will be at 3:05.
Since the buses from stop A to stop C set out every 15 minutes, the next bus after 2:45 will be at 2:55.
Since the buses from stop A to stop D set out every 10 minutes, the next bus after 2:45 will be at 2:55 as well.

Step 2: Now, let's find the common multiple of the intervals for the three buses. The least common multiple (LCM) of 10, 15, and 20 is 60.

answer: The three bosses will appear together again at 11:10.,12:10,"

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods for the three bosses.
The periods are 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 40 minutes.
First, convert the minutes to a common unit:
30 minutes = 0.5 hours
40 minutes = 0.66667 hours (approximately)

Now, find the LCM of 1, 0.5, and 0.66667 hours.
Since the LCM of 1 and 0.5 is 1, and the LCM of 1 and 0.66667 is approximately 1, the LCM of all three periods is 1 hour.

Step 2: Calculate the time difference between the first and second appearance of the bosses together.
The first appearance of the bosses together was at 10:10.
The next time they appear together will be when their periods align again, which is after 1 hour (the LCM).

Step 2: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of their work rates.
The LCM of 90, 120, and 60 is 360 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for them to assemble three bikes together.
Since they started at 8:10, they have worked for 8*60 + 10 = 510 minutes by the time they finish the third bike.

Step 4: Find the time it takes for them to assemble three more bikes together.
Since they work at a combined rate of 360 minutes per bike, it takes them 360*3 = 1080 minutes to assemble three more bikes.

Step 5: Add the time it takes to assemble three more bikes to the time they finished the third bike.
1080 + 510 = 1590 minutes

1. First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of the cleaning rates of A, B, and C. The LCM of 8, 12, and 14 is 84 (8*10*3).

2. Now, let's determine how many windows each cleaner can clean in one hour (60 minutes).
   - A can clean 60/8 = \boxed{7.5} windows.
   - B can clean 60/12 = \boxed{5} windows.
   - C can clean 60/14 = \boxed{4.285714285714286} windows.

3. Since A can clean 7.5 windows in an hour, we need to find the next multiple of 7.5 that is greater than or equal to the sum of the windows cleaned by B and C in an hour.
   - B can clean 5 windows in an hour, and C can clean 4.285714285714286 windows in an hour.
   - The sum is 5 + 4.285714285714286 = \boxed{9.285714285714286} windows.
   - The next multiple of 7.5 greater than or equal to 9.285714285714286 is 10.5 (since 11.25 is not a whole number).

4. Now, let's find the time it takes for A to clean 10.5 windows.
   - A can clean 1 window every 8 minutes, so it takes 10.5/1 = \boxed{10.5} hours to clean 10.5 windows.

5. Since they started cleaning at 14:15, and it takes 10.5 hours to clean 10.5 windows, they will start cleaning windows at the same time again at 14:15 + 10.5 hours = \boxed{02:15 the next day}.

Solution:

1. First, let's find the work rate (trees cut per minute) for each worker:
   - Worker X: 1/16 trees per minute
   - Worker Y: 1/32 trees per minute
   - Worker C: 1/24 trees per minute

2. To find the combined work rate, we add the work rates of all three workers:
   - Combined work rate = (1/16) + (1/32) + (1/24)
   - Combined work rate = (1/16) + (3/192) + (1/48)
   - Combined work rate = (1/16) + (3/192) + (4/192)
   - Combined work rate = (8/192) + (3/192)
   - Combined work rate = (11/192) trees per minute

3. Now, let's find out how many trees they cut together in one minute:
   - Trees cut per minute = (11/192) * 3 (since there are three workers)
   - Trees cut per minute = (33/192) trees per minute

4. Since they started cutting trees at 7:48, let's find out how many trees they have cut by 8:00 (2 minutes later):
   - Trees cut in 2 minutes = (33/192) * 2
   - Trees cut in 2 minutes = (66/192)
   - Trees cut in 2 minutes = (1/3)
   - Since they cut one tree every 3 minutes, the number of full 3-minute intervals is:
   - Full 3-minute intervals = (1/3) / 3
   - Full 3-minute intervals = 1
   - So, they will have cut 1 tree in 2 minutes, which means they have 2 trees left.

5. Now, let's find out how long it takes to cut the remaining 2 trees:
   - Time to cut 2 trees = (2 trees) / (work rate of all three workers)
   - Time to cut 2 trees = (2 trees) / (33/192)
   - Time to cut 2 trees = (192/33) * 2
   - Time to cut 2 trees = (384/33)
   - Time to cut 2 trees = 12 minutes

6. Adding the 2 minutes from 8:00 to the 12 minutes to cut the remaining trees, we get:
   - Total time = 8:00 + 12 minutes
   - Total time = 8:12

\boxed{answer: 8:12}",The answer is 9:24,"Three workers are working to cut the trees. Worker X can cut a tree every 16 min, Worker Y every 32 min and Worker C every 24 min.

Solution:

1. First, let's find the work rate (inverse of the time) for each carpenter.
   - Carpenter A: 1/40 min^{-1}
   - Carpenter B: 1/(60+20) = 1/80 min^{-1}
   - Carpenter C: 1/(60*2+40) = 1/100 min^{-1}

2. To find the common multiple of their work rates, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators (40, 80, 100). The LCM of 40, 80, and 100 is 400.

3. Now, let's find the common work rate, which is the work rate of one carpenter when all three are working together. It is the sum of their individual work rates:
   - Common work rate = (1/40) + (1/80) + (1/100) = 1/40 + 1/80 + 3/800 = 11/200 min^{-1}

4. To find the time it takes for them to install three doors together, we can take the reciprocal of the common work rate:
   - Time = 1 / (11/200) = 200/11 minutes

5. Since they started installing doors at 9:15, let's find the time when they will install doors at the same time again. Adding 200/11 minutes to 9:15 gives us:
   - Time = 9:15 + (200/11) minutes

6. To convert the fractional part of the time to minutes, we multiply 200/11 by 60 (minutes per hour) and get 1227.27 minutes.

Let's denote the number of bad oranges as x.

Step 2: The ratio of good oranges to bad oranges is given as 3:1. This means that for every 3 good oranges, there is 1 bad orange.

Step 3: To find the total parts in the ratio, we add the parts of the good oranges and the parts of the bad oranges.
Total parts = 3 (parts of good oranges) + 1 (part of bad oranges) = 4 parts

Step 4: Since there are 24 good oranges, the number of parts for good oranges is 24 / 3 = 8 parts.

Step 5: Since there are 4 parts in total, the number of parts for bad oranges is 4 - 8 = -4. However, the number of parts cannot be negative, so we need to find the absolute value of the difference.

Step 6: The absolute value of the difference is |-4| = 4. This means that the number of parts for bad oranges is 4.

Step 7: Since each part represents one orange, the number of bad oranges is the number of parts times the number of oranges per part.

Step 1: We know that the ratio of red balls to white balls is 4:5.

Step 2: Let the number of white balls be W.

Step 3: Since the total number of balls is 16 (red balls) + W (white balls), we have the equation: 16 + W = 4r, where r is the number of red balls.

Step 4: We also know that the ratio of red balls to white balls is 4:5, so r = 4/9 * W.

Step 5: Substitute r in the first equation: 16 + W = 4(4/9 * W).

Step 6: Simplify the equation: 16 + W = 16/3 * W.

Step 7: Solve for W: 2/3 * W = 16, W = 48.

Step 8: Since the number of white balls cannot be negative, we check if our solution is reasonable. In this case, it is reasonable because the total number of balls (16 + 48 = 64) is a multiple of the sum of the parts of the given ratio (4 + 5 = 9).

Step 9: The final answer is \boxed{48}. There are 48 white balls in the play school.",The answer is 20,"In a play school, there are 16 red balls and the rest are white balls. The ratio of red balls to white balls is 4:5. Find the number of white balls."

   Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...
   Multiples of 10: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, ...

   The least common multiple of 5 and 10 is 10, because it is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 5 and 10.

Step 6: To make the number of cups and plates equal, we need to adjust the number of packages of each item so that their total number is a multiple of 10.

Step 7: Since 5x = 10y, we can rewrite the equation as x = (10/5)y = 2y. This means that for every package of plates, we need 2 packages of cups.

Step 8: To find the least number of packages of each item, we can start with the smallest possible number of packages of plates and calculate the corresponding number of packages of cups.

Step 9: If we start with 1 package of plates, then we need 2 * 1 = \boxed{2} packages of cups.

So, the least number of packages of each item you need to buy is \boxed{2} packages of cups and \boxed{1} package of plates.",The answer is 3,"Cups are sold 5 to a package and plates are sold 10 to a package. If you want to have the same number of each item for a party, what is the least number of packages of each you need to buy?"

Step 1: To find the greatest number of pieces of fruit Mei can put in each basket, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of oranges, peaches, and pears.

Step 2: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. First, we find the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number, and then we repeat the process with the smaller number and the remainder until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

Step 3: Let's start with the largest number, which is the number of pears (18). We divide it by the number of oranges (15): 18 ÷ 15 = 1 with a remainder of 3.

Step 4: Now we divide the number of peaches (9) by the remainder (3): 9 ÷ 3 = 3.

Step 5: Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 3.

Step 6: Therefore, the greatest number of pieces of fruit Mei can put in each basket is \boxed{3}.",The answer is 3,"Mei has 15 oranges, 9 peaches and 18 pears. She wants to put all of the fruit into baskets with each basket having the same number of pieces of fruit in it.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of days Hillary swims, runs, and cycles.

LCM(6, 4, 16) = 16

Step 2: Since Hillary does all three activities on the same day when the number of days since the last time she did all three activities is a multiple of 16, we need to find the smallest positive multiple of 16 that is greater than or equal to the sum of the number of days she swims, runs, and cycles.

Sum of days: 6 (swim) + 4 (run) + 16 (cycle) = 26

The smallest positive multiple of 16 that is greater than 26 is 32.

Step 3: Subtract the sum of the number of days she swims, runs, and cycles from the smallest positive multiple of 16 that is greater than the sum.

Days until next set of activities: 32 - 26 = \boxed{6}

So, Hillary will do all three activities again on the same day in 6 days.",The answer is 48,"At the gym, Hillary swims every 6 days, runs every 4 days and cycles every 16 days. If she did all three activities today, in how many days will she do all three activities again on the same day?"

Solution:
1. To find the greatest number of CDs Oscar can pack in each box, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of rock CDs, classical CDs, and pop CDs.
2. We can list the factors of each number:
   - Rock CDs: 1, 2, 7, 14
   - Classical CDs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
   - Pop CDs: 1, 2, 4, 8
3. The greatest common divisor is the largest number that divides each of the numbers. In this case, it is 1 (since 1 is a factor of all three numbers).
4. However, since Oscar wants to pack the same number of CDs in each box, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers.
5. We can start with the smallest factor of each number and check if it is a multiple of all three numbers.
6. Starting with 1, we find that it is not a multiple of all three numbers.
7. Moving to the next number, 2, we find that it is a multiple of the rock CDs and classical CDs but not the pop CDs.
8. Moving to the next number, 4, we find that it is a multiple of all three numbers.
9. So, the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers is 4.
10. However, since Oscar cannot pack fewer CDs than he has, the greatest number of CDs Oscar can pack in each box is the number of pop CDs, which is 8.

\boxed{answer = 8}",The answer is 2,"Oscar needs to ship 14 rock CDs, 12 classical CDs, and 8 pop CDs. He can pack only one type of CD in each box and he must pack the same number of CDs in each box. What is the greatest number of CDs Oscar can pack in each box?"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many days pass between two full moons. Since a full moon occurs every 30 days, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

days_between_full_moons = 30 * number_of_full_moons

Step 2: Now, we need to find out how many full moons occur between the last full moon and the next one that falls on a Friday. Since the last full moon occurred on a Friday, the next full moon that falls on a Friday will be the first full moon that occurs after 7 days (since Friday is the 5th day of the week).

Let's denote the number of full moons between the last full moon and the next one that falls on a Friday as 'n'. Then, the number of days between the last full moon and the next one that falls on a Friday can be calculated as follows:

days_between_last_and_next_friday_full_moon = 7 + 30 * n

Step 3: Since the next full moon that falls on a Friday will be the first full moon of the next month, we can find the number of full moons 'n' by dividing the total number of days in a year by the number of days between two full moons and rounding down to the nearest integer:

n = (total_days_in_a_year - days_between_last_and_next_friday_full_moon) / days_between_full_moons

Step 4: Calculate the total number of days in a year:

total_days_in_a_year = 365

Step 5: Substitute the values into the equation from Step 3:

n = (total_days_in_a_year - days_between_last_and_next_friday_full_moon) / days_between_full_moons

n = (365 - (7 + 30 * n)) / 30

Step 6: Solve the equation:

30n + 7 = 365
30n = 358
n = 11.933333333333334

Since we cannot have a fraction of a full moon, we round down to the nearest integer:

n = 11

Step 7: Calculate the number of days between the last full moon and the next one that falls on a Friday:

days_between_last_and_next_friday_full_moon = 7 + 30 * n
days_between_last_and_next_friday_full_moon = 7 + 30 * 11
days_between_last_and_next_friday_full_moon = 347

Step 8: Calculate the number of days between the last full moon and the next full moon that falls on a Friday:

days_between_full_moons = 30 * number_of_full_moons
days_between_full_moons = 30 * (11 + 1)
days_between_full_moons = 330

Step 9: Calculate the number of days between the last full moon and the next full moon that falls on a Friday:

days_between_last_and_next_full_moon = days_between_last_and_next_friday_full_moon - days_between_full_moons
days_between_last_and_next_full_moon = 347 - 330
days_between_last_and_next_full_moon = 17

Step 10: The final answer is:

Step 1: Let's denote the number I put in as x.

Step 2: The machine added 15 to the number I put in, so x + 15 = 35.

Step 2: Let's find the number that Jordon put in when she got 53. That number is 25 (as given in the problem).

Step 3: To find the number that Jordon put in when she got 16, we need to reverse the process. First, subtract 3 from 53 to get 50. Then, divide 50 by 2 to get 25.

Step 4: So, when Jordon put in 16, the number that came out of her machine was 29 (since 29 doubled and added 3 equals 58, and half of 58 is 29).

\boxed{answer = 29}",The answer is 35,"Jordon has a different kind of number machine. Her machine doubles the number and adds 3 more. So when Jordon put in 25, the number 53 came out of the machine. Jordon put in the number 16. What number do you think came out of her machine?"

Step 4: We know the final result was 27, so we can set up an equation: (2 * x) + 3 = 27

Step 5: Solving for x, we subtract 3 from both sides: 2 * x = 24

Step 6: Then, we divide both sides by 2: x = 12

Step 1: Let's denote the number of marbles Drew had at first as D and the number of marbles Marcus had at first as M.

Step 2: We know that D - 12 = M and D + M = 50 (since each boy had 25 marbles after the exchange).

Step 3: To solve this system of equations, we can add the two equations together:

D - 12 + D + M = 50 + M
2D + M = 62

Step 4: Now, let's subtract M from both sides to isolate D:

2D = 62 - M
D = (62 - M) / 2

Step 5: Since Drew gave 12 marbles to Marcus, we can find the value of M:

M = D + 12
M = ((62 - M) / 2) + 12

Step 6: To find the value of M, we need to solve the quadratic equation:

62 - M = 2(M + 12)
62 - M = 2M + 24

Step 7: Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:

-M = -24 - 62 + 2M
0 = 4M - 86

Step 8: Divide both sides by 4 to get the quadratic equation:

M - 21.5 = 0
M = 21.5

Step 9: Now that we have the value of M, we can find the value of D:

D = (62 - M) / 2
D = (62 - 21.5) / 2
D = 40.5 / 2
D = 20.25

Step 10: Since the number of marbles must be a whole number, we round Drew's initial number of marbles to the nearest whole number:

answer: Difference in pages = 8 * x,8,"

Step 1: Let's find out how many pages each person read in a certain number of days.

Greg's pages = Reading rate * Number of days
Greg's pages = 18 pages/day * x days

Brad's pages = Reading rate * Number of days
Brad's pages = 26 pages/day * x days

Step 2: To find out how many more pages Brad read than Greg, we subtract Greg's pages from Brad's pages.

Difference in pages = Brad's pages - Greg's pages
Difference in pages = (26 pages/day * x days) - (18 pages/day * x days)

Step 3: Simplify the equation by subtracting the same term on both sides.

Difference in pages = 8 pages/day * x days

Step 4: Since we want the number of pages, not the rate, we can drop the ""pages/day"" part.

Step 1: Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x inches and the length of the longer piece as y inches.

Step 2: We know that the total length of the two pieces is 40 inches, so we can write an equation: x + y = 40

Step 3: We also know that the longer piece is 10 inches longer than the shorter piece, so we can write another equation: y = x + 10

Step 4: Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:

Step 1: Let's denote the number of stickers Cindy had as C and the number of stickers Dan had as D.

Step 2: We know that Cindy used 15 stickers, so C = C - 15.

Step 3: Dan bought 18 more stickers than Cindy, so D = C + 18.

Step 4: Since Cindy and Dan had the same number of stickers before, we can say that C = D - 18.

Step 5: Now we have a system of two equations:

   C - 15 = D - 18
   C = D - 18

Step 6: Solving the system of equations, we can see that C + 15 = D - 18 + 15, which simplifies to C = D - 3.

Step 7: Since Cindy used 15 stickers, we can say that C = D - 3 - 15.

Step 8: Substituting D - 3 - 15 for C in the second equation, we get D - 3 = D - 3 - 15 + 15, which simplifies to D = 18.

Step 9: Now we can find the difference in the number of stickers: Dan had 18 stickers and Cindy had (D - 18) stickers, so Dan had 18 - (D - 18) = 18 - 18 + 18 = \boxed{18} more stickers than Cindy.",The answer is 33,Cindy and Dan have the same number of stickers.

Step 1: Let's denote the number of marbles Ed had as E and the number of marbles Doug had as D.

Step 2: We know that E = D + 22.

Step 3: Doug lost 8 marbles, so now he has D - 8 marbles.

Step 4: To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug after Doug lost 8 marbles, we subtract the number of marbles Doug has now from the number of marbles Ed initially had: E - (D - 8).

Step 5: Since E = D + 22, we can substitute E in the equation: (D + 22) - (D - 8).

Step 6: Simplify the equation: 22 + 8 = 30.

Step 7: So, Ed had \boxed{30} more marbles than Doug after Doug lost 8 marbles.",The answer is 30,Ed had 22 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 8 of his marbles at the playground. How many more marble did Ed have than Doug then?

Step 1: Let's find the difference between the number of cans found on consecutive days.
Difference = Cans on day 2 - Cans on day 1 = 9 - 4 = 5

Step 2: Now, let's find the difference between the number of cans found on the third day and the second day.
Difference = Cans on day 3 - Cans on day 2 = 14 - 9 = 5

Step 3: Since the difference between the number of cans found on consecutive days is constant, we can use this information to find the number of cans found on the seventh day.

Step 4: To find the number of cans on the seventh day, we need to multiply the difference by the number of days between the second day and the seventh day, and then add the number of cans found on the second day.

Cans on day 7 = (Difference * (Number of days - 1)) + Cans on day 2
Cans on day 7 = (5 * (7 - 1)) + 9 = 5 * 6 + 9 = 30 + 9 = \boxed{39} cans.",The answer is 34,"Zachary collects cans for the recycling club. On the first day, he found 4 cans.

Step 1: Let's list the items and their costs:
- Ruler: $0.29
- Folder: $0.25
- Pencils: $x (unknown)

Step 2: We know that David spent a total of 74 cents. So, we can write an equation:
0.29 (ruler) + 0.25 (folder) + x (pencils) = 0.74 (total)

Step 3: David bought 2 pencils, so the cost of the pencils is 2 times the cost of one pencil. We can rewrite the equation as:
0.29 + 0.25 + 2x = 0.74

Step 4: To find the cost of one pencil, we need to isolate x. First, let's subtract 0.29 and 0.25 from both sides:
2x + 0.29 + 0.25 = 0.74 - 0.29 - 0.25
2x = 0.18

Step 1: Let's denote Annette's weight as A, Caitlin's weight as C, and Sara's weight as S.

Step 2: We know that Annette and Caitlin together weigh 95 pounds, so A + C = 95.

Step 3: We also know that Caitlin and Sara together weigh 87 pounds, so C + S = 87.

Step 4: To find the difference in weight between Annette and Sara, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously. Let's subtract the second equation from the first: (A + C) - (C + S) = 95 - 87.

Step 5: This simplifies to A - S = 8.

Step 6: Now we have the equation for the difference in weight between Annette and Sara. To find the actual weights, we would need additional information, but since the question asks for the difference in weight, we can stop here.

Step 4: To find the total cost, we add the costs of all three presents:

Total cost = x + 25 + 7

Step 5: Since we know the cost of the first present, we can find the total cost:

Total cost = x + 32

Step 6: However, the problem does not provide the cost of the first present, so we cannot find the exact total cost.

Final answer: \boxed{The total cost cannot be determined with the given information.}",The answer is 50,Kyle bought 3 presents. The first present cost $18. The second present cost $7 more than the first. The third present cost $11 less than the first. How much did Kyle pay for all 3 presents?
answer: The number of apples in the first and third bags together cannot be determined.,19,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of apples in the first bag as x, the number of apples in the second bag as y, and the number of apples in the third bag as z.

Step 2: We know that x + y = 11 (from the information about the first and second bags) and y + z = 18 (from the information about the second and third bags).

Step 3: We also know that x + y + z = 24 (from the total number of apples).

Step 4: Now we have a system of three linear equations with three variables:

   x + y = 11
   y + z = 18
   x + y + z = 24

Step 5: To solve this system, we can use the elimination method. First, let's add the first two equations:

   (x + y) + (y + z) = 11 + 18
   x + 2y + z = 29

Step 6: Now, let's subtract the third equation from the new equation we just found:

   (x + 2y + z) - (x + y + z) = 29 - 24
    y + z = 5

Step 7: We now have a new equation: y + z = 5. Since we don't have enough information to find the exact values of x, y, and z, we can't determine the exact number of apples in the first and third bags together. However, we can find the difference between the total number of apples and the number of apples in the second bag, which is equal to the number of apples in the first and third bags together:

   24 - 11 = 13 (apples in the first and third bags together)

Step 8: Since we can't provide the exact number of apples in the first and third bags, we'll leave the final answer in the following format:

Step 4: Substitute R for P in the total weight equation: R + R + S = 90.

Step 5: Simplify the equation: 2R + S = 90.

Step 6: Since R = P, we can substitute R for P in the equation Peter and Skeeter know they weigh together: R + S = 68.

Step 1: Let x be the number of apples in the box at first.

Step 2: Paul put half of the apples aside, which means he took out x/2 apples.

Step 3: He put 25 apples in the refrigerator, so the number of apples left is x - x/2 - 25.

Step 4: The number of apples left for the muffins is 6, so we have the equation: x - x/2 - 25 = 6.

Step 5: To solve for x, we first multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2(x - x/2 - 25) = 2 * 6.

Step 6: This simplifies to x - x - 50 = 12, which can be rewritten as x - x = 12 + 50.

Step 7: Since x - x equals 0, we have 12 + 50 = 0, which is not true. This means there was an error in the problem, and it cannot be solved as stated.

Step 4: Then he went up 16 floors, so he is now F - 10 + 16 = F + 6 floors below the top.

Step 5: Since he is only 2 floors away from the top, we have F + 6 = F - 2.

Step 6: Solving for F, we get F + 6 - F = -2, which simplifies to F = 4.

Step 7: However, this solution is not possible because the number of floors cannot be negative. Let's consider the error in our calculation.

Step 8: We made a mistake in step 4 when we added the 16 floors. Instead, we should have subtracted the 16 floors from the number of floors he was below the top, which is F - 10. So, F - 10 - 16 = F - 26.

Step 1: First, let's find out how many hamburgers Martin sells before 6 o'clock.

Before 6 o'clock, Martin sells 48 hamburgers.

Step 2: Next, let's find out how many hamburgers Martin sells after 6 o'clock.

After 6 o'clock, Martin sells 28 more hamburgers than he did before 6 o'clock. So, we subtract the number of hamburgers he sold before 6 o'clock from the total number of hamburgers he sells after 6 o'clock.

Total hamburgers sold after 6 o'clock = Total hamburgers sold - Hamburgers sold before 6 o'clock

Total hamburgers sold = Number of hours worked * Hamburgers sold per hour

Since Martin works 24 hours each week, we can assume that he sells the same number of hamburgers per hour. Let's denote the number of hamburgers sold per hour as ""h"".

Total hamburgers sold = 24h

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of hamburgers sold after 6 o'clock:

hamburgers sold after 6 o'clock = (24h) - 48

Step 3: To find the number of hamburgers sold after 6 o'clock, we need to find the value of ""h"". Since we know that Martin sells 28 more hamburgers after 6 o'clock, we can set up another equation:

hamburgers sold after 6 o'clock = 28

Now, we have two equations with one variable:

1) (24h) - 48 = 28
2) Let's denote the number of hamburgers sold per hour as ""h""

Step 4: To solve the system of equations, we can add 48 to both sides of equation 1:

24h = 76

Now, we can divide both sides by 24 to find the number of hamburgers sold per hour:

h = 76 / 24
h = 3.166666666666667

Since it's not possible to sell a fraction of a hamburger, we can round up to the nearest whole number:

h = 4

Step 5: Now that we know Martin sells 4 hamburgers per hour, we can find the number of hamburgers sold after 6 o'clock:

hamburgers sold after 6 o'clock = (24h) - 48
hamburgers sold after 6 o'clock = (24 * 4) - 48
hamburgers sold after 6 o'clock = 96 - 48
hamburgers sold after 6 o'clock = \boxed{48}

So, Martin sells 48 hamburgers after 6 o'clock.",The answer is 76,Martin works at the Hungry Hippo. He sells 48 hamburgers before 6 o'clock. He sells 28 more hamburgers than that after 6 o'clock. He works 24 hours each week. How many hamburgers does Martin sell after 6 o'clock?

25 + 7 = x + 25
32 = x
So, Charlotte's backpack weighs 32 - 25 = \boxed{7} pounds.

Step 1: Add the number of jugs of water and the number of jugs of sports drink together to find the total number of beverages.
Total beverages = Jugs of water + Jugs of sports drink
Total beverages = 16 + 12
Total beverages = \boxed{28}

Step 2: To find the greatest number of refreshment stations, we need to divide the total number of beverages by the number of beverages at each station.
Number of stations = Total beverages / Beverages per station

Step 3: Since there are 16 jugs of water and 12 jugs of sports drink, there are 28 beverages in total. If we assume that each station has 1 jug of water and 1 jug of sports drink, then the number of stations would be:
Number of stations = Total beverages / (Jugs of water per station + Jugs of sports drink per station)

There is no solution to this problem.,240,"

Step 1: Let x be the number of tulip bulbs and y be the number of daffodil bulbs. Since Rita wants the same number of each type of bulb, we can write the equation x = y.

Step 2: Since tulip bulbs come in packs of 15, we can write the equation 15x = total number of tulip bulbs. Similarly, since daffodil bulbs come in packs of 16, we can write the equation 16y = total number of daffodil bulbs.

Step 3: Since x = y, we can substitute y with x in the second equation: 16x = total number of daffodil bulbs.

Step 4: We want to find the least number of each type of bulb Rita will need to buy. To do this, we'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 16, which is 60. This means that Rita will need to buy enough bulbs so that the total number of bulbs is a multiple of 60.

Step 5: Now we have two equations:

15x = total number of tulip bulbs
16x = total number of daffodil bulbs

Since both equations have the same variable x, we can set them equal to each other:

15x = 16x

Step 6: Solving for x, we get:

15x - 16x = 0
x(-15 + 16) = 0
x = 0

However, since we're looking for the least number of bulbs, x cannot be 0. This means that there is no solution to this problem where Rita can buy the same number of tulips and daffodils and have the total number of bulbs be a multiple of 60.

Final answer: \boxed{There is no solution to this problem.}",The answer is 240,"Rita is buying flower bulbs for her garden. She wants to buy the same number of tulips and daffodils.

answer: Kathleen can distribute materials to 9 dental offices.,6,"

Step 1: We need to find the greatest number of dental offices that Kathleen can distribute materials to without having any materials left over.

Step 2: To do this, we will find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of brochures (18) and the number of pamphlets (12).

Step 3: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:

   a) Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder: 18 ÷ 12 = 1 with a remainder of 6.

   b) Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder: 12 ÷ 6 = 2 with a remainder of 0.

   c) Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last quotient we found, which is 2.

Step 4: Now that we have the GCD, we can determine the greatest number of dental offices Kathleen can distribute materials to by dividing the total number of brochures by the GCD: 18 ÷ 2 = 9.

Step 1: To make all the pieces of cord the same length, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two lengths.

Step 2: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let's denote the two lengths as a and b, where a = 15 and b = 12.

Step 3: We start by finding the remainder when a is divided by b:

   Remainder = a mod b = 15 mod 12 = 3

Step 4: Now we swap the roles of a and b, and repeat the process with the new values:

   a = b
   b = Remainder

   a = 12
   b = 3

Step 5: We repeat the process again:

   Remainder = a mod b = 12 mod 3 = 0

Step 6: Since the remainder is 0, we have found the GCD. In this case, the GCD of 15 and 12 is 3.

Step 7: To find the greatest length that Matt can make, we take the maximum of the two original lengths divided by the GCD:

Step 1: Let's denote the number of pens as P and the number of pencils as Pencil. Since Philip wants to buy the same number of pens as pencils, we can write the equation:

P = Pencil

Step 2: Since pens come in packages of 12 and pencils come in packages of 15, we need to find the smallest number of each that can be bought without any leftovers.

Step 3: To find the smallest number of pencils, we can divide the number of pencils in a package by the number of pencils Philip wants to buy:

Number of pencils = Pencil / 15

Step 4: Now, we need to find the smallest number of pens that corresponds to this number of pencils. Since pens come in packages of 12, we can multiply the number of pencils by 12:

Number of pens = P = Pencil

Step 5: To find the smallest number of pencils that can be bought without any leftovers, we can divide the number of pencils in a package by the number of pencils Philip wants to buy and round up to the nearest whole number:

Number of pencils = Ceiling(15 / Pencil)

Step 6: Since we want the smallest number of pens, we also want the smallest number of pencils. To find the smallest number of pencils, we can start with a small value and test it in the equation:

If Pencil = 1, then Number of pencils = Ceiling(15 / 1) = 16, which is not possible since we want the smallest number of pencils.

If Pencil = 2, then Number of pencils = Ceiling(15 / 2) = 8, which is not possible since we want the smallest number of pencils.

If Pencil = 3, then Number of pencils = Ceiling(15 / 3) = 6, which is not possible since we want the smallest number of pencils.

If Pencil = 4, then Number of pencils = Ceiling(15 / 4) = 4, which is possible.

Step 7: Now that we have found the smallest number of pencils, we can find the corresponding number of pens:

Number of pens = P = Pencil = 4

Step 8: To find the smallest number of packages of pens and pencils that Philip can buy, we can divide the number of pens and pencils by the number of pens per package and the number of pencils per package, respectively:

Number of pen packages = Number of pens / Pens per package = 4 / 12 = 1/3
Number of pencil packages = Number of pencils / Pencils per package = 4 / 15

Since we cannot buy a fraction of a package, we need to round up the number of pen packages to the nearest whole number:

Number of pen packages = Ceiling(1/3) = 1
Number of pencil packages = 4 / 15 = 4/15, which cannot be rounded up to a whole number.

However, since we are looking for the smallest number of pens, we can round up the number of pen packages to the nearest whole number and round down the number of pencil packages to the nearest whole number:

Number of pen packages = 1
Number of pencil packages = Ceiling(4/15) = 3

Step 9: To find the smallest number of packages of pens and pencils that Philip can buy, we can multiply the number of pen packages by the number of pens per package and the number of pencil packages by the number of pencils per package:

Number of pen packages * Pens per package = 1 * 12 = 12
Number of pencil packages * Pencils per package = 3 * 15 = 45

Step 10: Finally, we can add the number of pen packages and the number of pencil packages to find the smallest number of packages that Philip can buy:

Smallest number of packages = Number of pen packages + Number of pencil packages = 12 + 45 = \boxed{57}

So, the smallest number of packages of pens and pencils that Philip can buy is \boxed{57}.",The answer is 60,"Philip is buying pens and pencils from the store.

Step 1: Let's denote the number of ducks as D and the number of seagulls as S. Since the total number of ducks and seagulls is the same, we have:

D + S = Total number of birds

Step 2: We know that the ducks travel in flocks of 18 and the seagulls travel in flocks of 10. Let's denote the number of flocks of ducks as Fd and the number of flocks of seagulls as Fs. We have:

D = 18 * Fd
S = 10 * Fs

Step 3: Since the total number of ducks and seagulls is the same, we can rewrite the equation from step 1 as:

18 * Fd + 10 * Fs = Total number of birds

Step 4: To minimize the number of ducks, we want to maximize the number of seagulls. So, let's find the maximum value for Fs while still having an integer value for Fd.

Since the seagulls travel in flocks of 10, the number of seagulls in a flock must be a multiple of 10. The smallest possible flock size for seagulls is 10, and the smallest possible number of flocks for seagulls is 1.

Fs = 1
S = 10

Step 5: Now, we need to find the smallest possible flock size for ducks that will make the total number of birds an integer. Since the ducks travel in flocks of 18, the number of ducks in a flock must be a multiple of 18. The smallest possible flock size for ducks is 18, and the smallest possible number of flocks for ducks is 1.

Fd = 1
D = 18

Step 6: Now, we can check if the total number of birds is an integer:

18 * Fd + 10 * Fs = 18 + 10 = 28

Since 28 is an integer, the smallest number of ducks that Heather could have observed is \boxed{18}.",The answer is 90,"Heather enjoys bird-watching and observed two types of birds traveling this season: ducks and seagulls.

answer: The planner can set up 4 tables.,4,"

Step 1: We want to find the greatest number of tables that can be set up with the same number of adults and children at each table.

Step 2: Let's denote the number of tables as T. The number of adults at each table will be A, and the number of children at each table will be C.

Step 3: Since there are 12 adults in total, we have A * T = 12.

Step 4: Similarly, since there are 20 children in total, we have C * T = 20.

Step 5: To find the greatest number of tables, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 20. The GCD of 12 and 20 is 4.

Step 6: So, the number of tables (T) should be a multiple of 4. The smallest multiple of 4 that satisfies both equations is 4.

Step 7: If T = 4, then A = 12 / 4 = 3 and C = 20 / 4 = 5. This means that there are 3 adults and 5 children at each table.

Step 8: To check if there are any people left over, we can multiply the number of adults and children by the number of tables: 3 * 4 = 12 (adults) and 5 * 4 = 20 (children). These numbers match the total number of adults and children, so the planner can set up 4 tables.

Step 3: To find the smallest number of each type of soap, we want to find the smallest values of x and y that satisfy the equation. To do this, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 19.

Step 4: The LCM of 5 and 19 is 95.

Step 5: Now, we can find the smallest values of x and y that are multiples of 95. Since x and y are both positive, we can start with the smallest multiple of 95, which is 95 itself.

Step 6: Testing x = 95 and y = 95*19/5 = 380, we find that x/5 = 95/5 = 19 and y/19 = 380/19 ≈ 20, which is not an integer.

Step 7: Testing x = 190 and y = 190*19/5 = 760, we find that x/5 = 190/5 = 38 and y/19 = 760/19 ≈ 40, which is not an integer.

Step 8: Testing x = 380 and y = 380*19/5 = 1520, we find that x/5 = 380/5 = 76 and y/19 = 1520/19 ≈ 80, which is not an integer.

Step 9: Testing x = 760 and y = 760*19/5 = 3040, we find that x/5 = 760/5 = 152 and y/19 = 3040/19 ≈ 160, which is not an integer.

Step 10: Testing x = 1520 and y = 1520*19/5 = 6080, we find that x/5 = 1520/5 = 304 and y/19 = 6080/19 ≈ 324, which is not an integer.

Step 11: Testing x = 3040 and y = 3040*19/5 = 12160, we find that x/5 = 3040/5 = 608 and y/19 = 12160/19 ≈ 639, which is not an integer.

Step 12: Testing x = 6080 and y = 6080*19/5 = 24576, we find that x/5 = 6080/5 = 1216 and y/19 = 24576/19 ≈ 1288, which is not an integer.

Step 13: Testing x = 12160 and y = 12160*19/5 = 48624, we find that x/5 = 12160/5 = 2432 and y/19 = 48624/19 ≈ 2564, which is not an integer.

Step 14: Testing x = 24320 and y = 24320*19/5 = 97280, we find that x/5 = 24320/5 = 4864 and y/19 = 97280/19 ≈ 5122, which is not an integer.

Step 15: Testing x = 48640 and y = 48640*19/5 = 194560, we find that x/5 = 48640/5 = 9728 and y/19 = 194560/19 ≈ 10332, which is not an integer.

Step 16: Testing Therefore, the answer is \boxed{x = 95, y = 95}. However, since the shop sells soap in boxes, the smallest possible numbers of each type of soap that the shop could have sold are multiples of 5 for bars and multiples of 19 for bottles. The smallest such numbers are \boxed",The answer is 95,Joe's Bath Shop sells bars of soap in boxes of 5 bars and bottles of soap in boxes of 19 bottles.

answer: 48,48,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of dimes as D. We know that the total number of coins is 77 and the number of quarters is 29.

Step 2: Since all the remaining coins are dimes, we can write the equation:

Total Coins = Quarters + Dimes
77 = 29 + D

Step 3: To find the number of dimes, we subtract the number of quarters from the total number of coins:

D = Total Coins - Quarters
D = 77 - 29
D = 48

Step 4: Now, we can find the difference between the total number of coins and the number of quarters:

Difference = Total Coins - Quarters
Difference = 77 - 29
Difference = 48

\boxed{answer: 48}",The answer is 48,Trevor counted 77 coins in his bank. He counted 29 quarters. The rest are dimes. How many more coints of the total than quarts does Trevor have?
Laurie has 37 marbles.,37,"

Step 1: Let's find out how many marbles Kurt has. Since Kurt has 45 marbles less than Dennis, we can write the equation:

Dennis - Kurt = 45

Step 2: We know that Dennis has 70 marbles, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

70 - Kurt = 45

Step 3: To find the value of Kurt, we can solve for Kurt by adding 45 to both sides of the equation:

70 = Kurt + 45

Step 4: Now, we can solve for Kurt by subtracting 45 from both sides of the equation:

Kurt = 70 - 45
Kurt = 25

Step 5: Since Laurie has 12 more marbles than Kurt, we can write the equation:

Laurie = Kurt + 12

Step 6: We know that Kurt has 25 marbles, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

Laurie = 25 + 12

Step 7: To find the value of Laurie, we can add 12 to both sides of the equation:

Laurie = 37

Step 8: Our final answer is in \boxed{answer} format:

Step 1: Let's represent the number of pairs of skates as S.

Step 2: We know that 18 people rented skates initially, so S - 18 represents the number of pairs of skates left after the first 18 people rented.

Step 3: Then, 25 more people rented skates during the first hour, so S - 18 - 25 represents the number of pairs of skates left after the first hour.

Step 4: Since there were originally 85 pairs of skates, we can set up an equation: S - 18 - 25 = 85 - S

Step 5: To solve for S, we can add S to both sides of the equation: S + S - 18 - 25 = 85

Step 6: Combining like terms, we get: 2S - 43 = 85

Step 7: To find S, we need to isolate S on one side of the equation. First, add 43 to both sides: 2S = 128

Step 8: Then, divide both sides by 2: S = 64

Step 9: However, since S represents the number of pairs of skates, it must be a whole number. But 64 is not a whole number when divided by 2. This means there is an error in the problem, as it is impossible to have 64 pairs of skates with the given information.

Step 1: First, let's find the difference between the number of loaves baked on consecutive days.

Difference = Loaves on Day (n) - Loaves on Day (n-1)

Step 2: Calculate the differences for each day:

Wednesday to Thursday: 7 - 5 = 2
Thursday to Friday: 10 - 7 = 3
Friday to Saturday: 14 - 10 = 4
Saturday to Sunday: 19 - 14 = 5

Step 3: We can see that the difference increases by 1 each day. To find the number of loaves baked on Monday, we need to find the difference between Sunday and Monday and add it to the number of loaves baked on Sunday.

Since the difference increases by 1 each day, the difference between Sunday and Monday is the same as the difference between Saturday and Sunday minus 1.

Difference = 5 - 1 = 4

Step 4: Add the difference to the number of loaves baked on Sunday:

Loaves on Monday = Loaves on Sunday + Difference

Subtract the number of books on the second shelf from the number of books on the third shelf: 18 - 6 = 12.
Subtract the number of books on the third shelf from the number of books on the fourth shelf: 54 - 18 = 36.

Step 3: Find the initial value.
Subtract the common difference from the number of books on the first shelf: 2 - 4 = -2.
Since it is not possible to have a negative number of books, we made an error in our calculation.
The correct initial value is the number of books on the first shelf, which is 2.

Step 4: Write the arithmetic sequence formula.
The formula for an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference.

Step 5: Find the number of terms.
We want to find the number of terms up to the fifth shelf.

Step 1: Identify the pattern.
The pattern is that the number of points scored increases by 1, 1, 2, 3, and 4 points between each level.

Step 2: Find the difference between the number of points scored on consecutive levels.
Let's call the number of points scored on the nth level P(n).

P(2) - P(1) = 2 - 2 = 0
P(3) - P(2) = 3 - 2 = 1
P(4) - P(3) = 8 - 3 = 5
P(5) - P(4) = 12 - 8 = 4

Step 3: Find the common difference (d) of the arithmetic sequence.
The common difference (d) is the difference between the number of points scored on any two consecutive levels.
In this case, d = 1, 1, 5, 4.
However, since the pattern is increasing, we should take the largest difference, which is 5.

Step 4: Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.
The formula for the nth term (P(n)) of an arithmetic sequence is P(n) = P(1) + (n - 1) * d.
Since we have found the common difference (d = 5), we can now find the number of points scored on the sixth level (P(6)).

P(6) = P(1) + (6 - 1) * 5
P(6) = 2 + (5) * 5
P(6) = 2 + 25
P(6) = \boxed{27}

The pattern is that the number of hammers ordered increases by 1, 0, 2, and 3 from June to September.

Step 2: Find the difference between the number of hammers ordered in consecutive months.
July - June = 4 - 3 = 1
August - July = 6 - 4 = 2
September - August = 9 - 6 = 3

Step 3: Find the common difference (d) in the arithmetic sequence.
The common difference (d) is the difference between any two consecutive terms in the sequence. In this case, d = 1 (July - June), d = 2 (August - July), and d = 3 (September - August), so the common difference is the average of these differences:
d = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2

Step 4: Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence (a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d) to find the number of hammers ordered in October.
October is the 5th month (June is the 1st month), so n = 5.
a_5 = a_1 + (5 - 1) * d
a_5 = a_1 + 4 * d
a_5 = 3 + 4 * 2
a_5 = 3 + 8
a_5 = \boxed{11}

So, the store will order 11 hammers in October if the pattern continues.",The answer is 13,"Last year, Springtown Hardware ordered 3 hammers in June, 4 hammers in July, 6 hammers in August, and 9 hammers in September. If this pattern continues, how many hammers will the store order in October?"

Step 1: Identify the pattern.
The number of power drills ordered each month increases by 1, 2, 3, and 5. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, 2, 3, and 5.

Step 2: Find the next common difference.
To find the next common difference, we can use the difference between the last two terms: 5 - 3 = 2.

Step 3: Find the general term of the sequence.
The general term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:

a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d

where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.

Since the first term is 5, the term number is 5 (for May), and the common difference is 2, we can find the May term as follows:

Step 1: First, let's find out how many liters of red paint Gina used. Since she filled up one third of the container, we can calculate the amount of red paint as follows:

Red paint (L) = Total volume (L) * (1/3)

Step 2: Next, let's find the total volume of the container. We know that Gina added 4 L of blue paint to the container, so the total volume is the sum of the red paint and the blue paint:

Total volume (L) = Red paint (L) + Blue paint (L)

Step 3: Now, we can substitute the red paint value from step 1 into the equation from step 2:

Total volume (L) = (Total volume (L) * (1/3)) + 4

Step 4: To solve for the total volume, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

3 * Total volume (L) = 3 * (Total volume (L) * (1/3)) + 12

Step 5: Simplify the equation:

3 * Total volume (L) = Total volume (L) + 12

Step 6: Rearrange the equation to isolate Total volume (L):

Total volume (L) - 3 * Total volume (L) = 12

Step 7: Solve for Total volume (L):

-2 * Total volume (L) = 12

Total volume (L) = -12 / -2

Total volume (L) = 6

Step 8: Now that we have the total volume, we can find the amount of red paint:

Red paint (L) = Total volume (L) * (1/3)
Red paint (L) = 6 * (1/3)
Red paint (L) = 2

Step 9: Since there are 1000 milliliters in a liter, we can convert the red paint volume to milliliters:

Red paint (mL) = Red paint (L) * 1000
Red paint (mL) = 2 * 1000
Red paint (mL) = 2000

Step 10: Finally, we can find the total amount of paint Gina mixed by adding the red paint and the blue paint:

Total paint (mL) = Red paint (mL) + Blue paint (mL)
Total paint (mL) = 2000 + 4000
Total paint (mL) = \boxed{6000}

Step 2: We know that the ratio of votes is 2:3, so we can write the equation:

B / M = 2 / 3

Step 3: We also know that the total number of votes is 60, so we can write another equation:

B + M = 60

Step 4: To solve this system of equations, we can first multiply the first equation by 3 to make the coefficients of B the same in both equations:

3B = 2M

Step 5: Now, we can solve for M:

M = (3B) / 2

Step 6: Substitute this expression for M into the second equation:

B + (3B) / 2 = 60

Step 7: Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2B + 3B = 120

Step 8: Combine like terms:

5B = 120

Step 9: Solve for B:

B = 120 / 5
B = 24

Step 10: The final answer is \boxed{Ben got 24 votes}.",The answer is 24,Ben and Matt received votes in the ratio 2:3. The total number of votes cast was 60. How many votes did Ben get?

Step 4: Solve for x: x = 35 / 4 = 8.75 inches.

Step 5: The length of the longer piece is 3x = 3 * 8.75 = \boxed{26.25 inches}.",The answer is 20,Terry cut a rope 35 inches long into two pieces in the ratio 3:4. What is the length of the longer piece?
18 cups,18,"

Step 1: First, let's find the total amount of lemonade and cranberry juice Lavender needs.
Lemonade = 3 parts
Cranberry juice = 5 parts

Step 2: Since the total volume of the bowl is 72 cups, we can find the total amount of juice needed by adding the parts of lemonade and cranberry juice together.
Total juice needed = 3 parts (lemonade) + 5 parts (cranberry juice) = 8 parts

Step 3: Now, let's find the total number of cups for 8 parts of juice. Since each part represents 9 cups (72 cups / 8 parts), we can calculate the total number of cups for 8 parts as follows:
Total cups = 8 parts * 9 cups/part = 72 cups

Step 4: Since the amount of lemonade and cranberry juice is the same (3 parts each), we can find the number of cups for each juice by multiplying the number of parts by the number of cups per part.
Lemonade cups = 3 parts * 9 cups/part = 27 cups
Cranberry juice cups = 5 parts * 9 cups/part = 45 cups

Step 5: Finally, let's find the difference between the number of cups of cranberry juice and lemonade.
Difference = Cranberry juice cups - Lemonade cups = 45 cups - 27 cups = \boxed{18 cups}

So, Lavender will need 18 more cups of cranberry juice than lemonade to fill the 72 cup bowl.",The answer is 18,Lavender is making punch for the school dance. She mixes 3 parts lemonade with 5 parts cranberry juice. She wants to fill a 72 cup bowl. How many more cups of cranberry juice will she need than lemonade?

Step 1: Let the two numbers be x and y, where x > y.

Step 2: According to the given ratio, the relationship between x and y is x/y = 5/7.

Step 3: To find the values of x and y, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

   x * 7 = y * 5
   x = (y * 5) / 7

Step 4: We know that the difference between the numbers is 12, so x - y = 12.

Step 5: Now we have a system of two equations:

   1) x = (y * 5) / 7
   2) x - y = 12

Step 6: To eliminate x, we can rewrite equation 1 as y = (7/5) * x.

Step 7: Substitute y in equation 2:

   (7/5) * x - x = 12
   (2/5) * x = 12

Step 8: Solve for x:

   x = (12 * 5) / 2
   x = 30

Step 9: Now we can find y using the equation y = (7/5) * x:

   y = (7/5) * 30
   y = 42

Step 10: The larger number is x, which is \boxed{30}.",The answer is 42,Two numbers are in the ratio 5:7. The difference between the numbers is 12. What is the larger number?
$109.43,81,"

Step 1: Let's denote the cost of a movie as M. Then, the cost of a DVD player is 9M.

Step 2: We know that the DVD player costs $63 more than a movie, so DVD player cost = M + $63.

Step 3: Since the ratio of the cost of a DVD player to the cost of a movie is 9:2, we can write the equation:

(DVD player cost) / (movie cost) = 9 / 2
(M + $63) / M = 9 / 2

Step 4: To solve for M, we can cross-multiply:

2(M + $63) = 9M
2M + $126 = 9M

Step 5: Now, we can subtract 2M from both sides of the equation:

$126 = 7M

Step 6: To find the cost of a DVD player, we can substitute M back into the equation we found earlier:

DVD player cost = M + $63
DVD player cost = ($126 / 7) + $63

Step 7: Now, we can calculate the cost of a DVD player:

DVD player cost = ($126 / 7) + $63
DVD player cost ≈ $109.43 (rounded to two decimal places)

Final answer: \boxed{$109.43}",The answer is 81,The ratio of the cost of a DVD player to the cost of a movie is 9:2. A DVD player costs $63 more than a movie. What is the cost of a DVD player?

Step 1: Let x be the length of the original piece of wire.

Step 2: The two smaller pieces are in a ratio of 7:5. Let s be the length of the shorter piece, and l be the length of the longer piece.

Step 3: We know that s/l = 7/5, and s = 40 cm.

Step 4: To find the value of l, we can cross-multiply and solve for l:

   (5 * s) = (7 * l)
   5 * 40 = 7 * l
   200 = 7l
   l = 200 / 7
   l ≈ 28.57 cm

Step 5: Now that we have the lengths of both pieces, we can find the total length of the original piece by adding the lengths of the two smaller pieces:

   x = s + l
   x = 40 cm + 28.57 cm
   x ≈ 68.57 cm

Step 6: The final answer is in \boxed{68.57} format. The original piece of wire was approximately 68.57 cm long.",The answer is 96,Armand cuts a piece of wire into two smaller pieces that are in a ratio 7:5. The shorter piece is 40 cm. What was the length of the original piece of wire?
answer: The new ratio of Ted's stickers to David's stickers is 6:4.,9:7,"

Step 1: Let T represent the number of stickers Ted has and D represent the number of stickers David has.

Step 2: We know that the total number of stickers is 24, and they are shared in the ratio 3:5. So, T + D = 24 and T/D = 3/5.

Step 3: We also know that David used 8 stickers, so D = 24 - 8 = 16.

Step 4: Substitute D into the ratio equation: T/16 = 3/5.

Step 5: Solve for T: T = (3/5) * 16 = 24/5.

Step 6: Now, we have the number of stickers for both Ted and David: Ted has 24/5 stickers and David has 16 stickers.

Step 1: Identify the pattern.
The number of carrot cakes made increases by 2 each month.

Step 2: Find the common difference.
The common difference is \boxed{2}.

Step 3: Use the formula for an arithmetic sequence to find the number of carrot cakes made in February.
The formula is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the number of the term.

Step 4: Plug in the values.

Step 1: Identify the pattern.
The number of text messages Jared sends each month increases by 1, 1, 2, and 4 respectively. This means the difference between the number of text messages sent in consecutive months increases by 1 each time.

Step 2: Find the common difference (d) of the sequence.
The common difference (d) is the difference between any two consecutive terms in the sequence. In this case, the differences are 1, 1, 2, and 4. The average of these differences is (1 + 1 + 2 + 4) / 4 = 2. Since the differences are increasing, we can round up to 3 as the common difference.

Step 3: Use the arithmetic sequence formula to find the number of text messages in March.
The formula for the nth term (a_n) of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. In this case, a_1 = 1 (the number of text messages sent in November), d = 3 (the common difference), and n = 3 (since we are finding the number of text messages sent in March, which is the 3rd month after November).

Step 4: Plug the values into the formula and solve for a_n.
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d
a_3 = 1 + (3 - 1) * 3

Step 1: Identify the pattern.
The number of berries Malia picks from each bush increases by 1, 1, 2, and 5 respectively.

Step 2: Find the common difference.
Since the difference between the number of berries picked from each bush increases by 1, 1, 2, and 5, there is no common difference. Instead, we have an arithmetic sequence with a variable common difference.

Step 3: Find the general term of the sequence.
The general term of an arithmetic sequence with a variable common difference can be represented as:

a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d

where:
- a_n is the nth term
- a_1 is the first term
- n is the term number
- d is the common difference

Since we don't have a common difference, we can rewrite the equation as:

a_n = a_1 + (n-1)(d_1 + (n-2)d_2 + (n-3)d_3 + ... + d_n)

where:
- d_1, d_2, d_3, ..., d_n are the differences between consecutive terms

Step 4: Find the differences between consecutive terms.
d_1 = 4 - 3 = 1
d_2 = 7 - 4 = 3
d_3 = 12 - 7 = 5

Step 5: Find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence of differences.
The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence can be represented as:

S_n = (n*(a_1 + a_n))/2

where:
- S_n is the sum of the first n terms
- a_1 is the first term
- a_n is the nth term

Since we don't have a common difference, we can rewrite the equation as:

S_n = (n*(a_1 + (a_1 + (n-1)(d_1 + (n-2)d_2 + (n-3)d_3 + ... + d_n))))/2

Step 6: Find the sum of the differences between consecutive terms up to the nth term.
S_4 = (4*(1 + (1 + 1*3 + 2*5)))/2
S_4 = (4*(1 + 1 + 3 + 10))/2
S_4 = (4*15)/2
S_4 = 60

Step 7: Find the nth term.
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)(d_1 + (n-2)d_2 + (n-3)d_3 + ... + d_n)
a_5 = 3 + (5-1)(1 + (5-2)3 + (5-3)1 + (5-4)0)
a_5 = 3 + (4)(1 + 3 + 1)
a_5 = 3 + 4(5)
a_5 = 3 + 20
a_5 = 23

Step 3: Determine the initial value.
The number of pieces of mail sent in April is the initial value.

Step 4: Use the arithmetic sequence formula to find the number of pieces of mail sent in August.
The formula for an arithmetic sequence is:
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d
where:
- a_n is the nth term
- a_1 is the first term
- d is the common difference
- n is the number of terms

Since we want to find the number of pieces of mail sent in August, we need to find the 4th term (since April is the 1st month).

Step 5: Plug the values into the formula.
a_4 = a_1 + (4 - 1)d

Step 6: Solve for a_4.
a_4 = 5 + (4 - 1)10

Solution:

1. To find the number of DVDs on the sixth rack, we need to find the common difference between the number of DVDs on consecutive racks.

2. The difference between the number of DVDs on the first and second racks is 2 (4 - 2 = 2).

3. The difference between the number of DVDs on the second and third racks is 4 (8 - 4 = 4).

4. The difference between the number of DVDs on the third and fourth racks is 8 (16 - 8 = 8).

5. The difference between the number of DVDs on the fourth and fifth racks is 16 (32 - 16 = 16).

6. Since the difference doubles with each rack, we can find the number of DVDs on the sixth rack by doubling the difference between the fifth and sixth racks.

Solution:

1. Let x be the number of cheese pizza slices on each platter and y be the number of veggie pizza slices on each platter.

2. We know that the total number of cheese slices must equal the total number of veggie slices, since the host wants to serve identical platters. So, we have the equation:

   x * number of cheese platters + y * number of veggie platters = Total cheese slices + Total veggie slices

3. The total number of cheese slices is 6, and the total number of veggie slices is 12.

4. To find the greatest number of platters, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6 and 12. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

5. To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:

   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number: 12 ÷ 6 = 2 remainder 0
   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder: 6 ÷ 0 (This means we have found the GCD, which is 6.)

6. Since the GCD of 6 and 12 is 6, the greatest number of platters the host can prepare is 6, with each platter containing 1 cheese slice and 5 veggie slices.

Final answer: \boxed{6}",The answer is 6,"At a party, the cheese pizza is cut into 6 slices and the veggie pizza is cut into 12 slices.

answer: Vondra can put together 7 bags of groceries.,7,"

Step 1: To find the greatest number of bags Vondra can put together, we need to find the common factor of the number of boxes of macaroni and cheese and the number of cans of vegetables.

Step 2: We can list the factors of 7 (1, 7) and the factors of 14 (1, 2, 7, 14). The common factor is 7.

Step 3: Since Vondra wants to divide the items evenly, she will put 7 boxes of macaroni and cheese and 7 cans of vegetables in each bag.

Step 4: To find the greatest number of bags, we divide the total number of items by the number of items in each bag.

Step 5: Total items = 7 boxes of macaroni and cheese + 14 cans of vegetables = 21 items

Step 6: Number of items in each bag = 7 boxes of macaroni and cheese + 7 cans of vegetables = 14 items

Step 7: Number of bags = Total items / Items per bag = 21 / 14

Step 8: Simplify the fraction: 21 / 14 = 7 / 4

Step 9: Since we cannot have a fraction of a bag, Vondra cannot put together more than 7 bags of groceries.

Step 1: First, let's find out how many total cans Lindsey has.
Total cans = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
Total cans = 16 + 8
Total cans = \boxed{24}

Step 2: Now, let's assume that Lindsey will stock the same number of cans for each refreshment table. Let x be the number of cans per table.

Step 3: Since Lindsey wants to use all the sodas, we can write an equation:
16 * x + 8 * x = 24

Step 4: Combine the terms:
24 * x = 24

Step 5: Divide both sides by 24:
x = 1

Step 6: However, since Lindsey wants to create tables, we need to find the greatest integer value for x. In this case, x = 1 is not a valid answer because it would mean that Lindsey is not creating any tables.

Step 7: To find the greatest integer value for x, we can round up the value from step 5:
x = 2

Step 8: Now, let's check if 2 cans per table is a valid solution:
16 * 2 + 8 * 2 = 32 + 16 = 48

Since 48 is not equal to 24, the solution x = 2 is not valid.

Step 9: Let's round up x again:
x = 3

Step 10: Now, let's check if 3 cans per table is a valid solution:
16 * 3 + 8 * 3 = 48 + 24 = 72

Since 72 is not equal to 24, the solution x = 3 is not valid.

Step 11: Let's round up x one more time:
x = 4

Step 12: Now, let's check if 4 cans per table is a valid solution:
16 * 4 + 8 * 4 = 64 + 32 = 96

Since 96 is not equal to 24, the solution x = 4 is not valid.

Step 13: Let's round up x one more time:
x = 5

Step 14: Now, let's check if 5 cans per table is a valid solution:
16 * 5 + 8 * 5 = 80 + 40 = 120

Since 120 is not equal to 24, the solution x = 5 is not valid.

Step 15: Let's round up x one more time:
x = 6

Step 16: Now, let's check if 6 cans per table is a valid solution:
16 * 6 + 8 * 6 = 96 + 48 = 144

Since 144 is not equal to 24, the solution x = 6 is not valid.

Step 17: Let's round up x one more time:
x = 7

Step 18: Now, let's check if 7 cans per table is a valid solution:
16 * 7 + 8 * 7 = 112 + 56 = 168

Since 168 is not equal to 24, the solution x = 7 is not valid.

Step 19: Let's round up x one more time:
x = 8

Step 20: Now, let's check if 8 cans per table is a valid solution:
16 * 8 + 8 * 8 = 128 + 64 = 192

Since 192 is not equal to 24, the solution x = 8 is not valid.

Step 21: Let's round up x one more time:
x = 9

Step 22: Now, let's check if 9 cans per table is a valid solution:
16 * 9 + 8 * 9 = 144 + 72 = 216

Since 216 is not equal to 24, the solution x = 9 is not valid.

answer: Jaden could put together 13 first-aid kits,13,"

Step 1: To find the greatest number of first-aid kits Jaden could put together, we need to find the common factor of the number of large bandages and the number of small bandages.

Step 2: We can list the factors of 39 and 26:

Factors of 39: 1, 3, 13, 39
Factors of 26: 1, 2, 13, 26

Step 3: The common factor of 39 and 26 is 13. This means that Jaden could put together 13 kits with 3 large bandages and 2 small bandages in each kit.

Step 4: To check if there are any bandages left over, we multiply the number of kits by the number of large bandages per kit and the number of small bandages per kit:

13 kits * 3 large bandages/kit * 2 small bandages/kit = 78 large bandages + 26 small bandages

Step 5: Since 78 + 26 = 104, which is greater than the total number of bandages (39 large + 26 small = 65), Jaden can put together 13 kits without any bandages left over.

Step 1: To find the greatest number of pages Tess can decorate, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of heart stickers and the number of star stickers.

Step 2: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. Let's denote the number of heart stickers as H and the number of star stickers as S.

   H = 45
   S = 27

Step 3: We perform the Euclidean algorithm steps:

   S = H % S (remainder of H divided by S)
   H = S
   S = H % S

Step 4: We continue the process until S is 0:

   S = 45 % 27 = 9
   H = 27
   S = 9

   S = 27 % 9 = 0

Step 5: The GCD of H and S is the last non-zero value of S, which is 9.

Step 6: To find the greatest number of pages Tess can decorate, we divide the total number of each type of sticker by the GCD:

   Number of pages = Min(Heart stickers / GCD, Star stickers / GCD)
   Number of pages = Min(45 / 9, 27 / 9)
   Number of pages = Min(5, 3)
   Number of pages = 3

answer: Daniel can display 4 groups of plates and 3 groups of spoons.,11,"

Step 1: To find the greatest number of groups Daniel can display, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of plates and the number of spoons.

Step 2: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. Let's denote the number of plates as P and the number of spoons as S.

Step 3: Since P > S, we can write P = qS + R, where q is the quotient and R is the remainder. In this case, q = 44 / 33 = 1 (with a remainder of 11).

Step 4: Now we have S = R'P' + R, where R' is the new remainder and P' is the new number of plates. In this case, R' = 11 / 44 = 0 (with a remainder of 11), and P' = 44.

Step 5: Since the remainder is not zero, we repeat the process with the new number of plates (P') and the original number of spoons (S). In this case, S = 33 = 3 * 11 + 0.

Step 6: Now we have found the GCD, which is the largest number that divides both P and S without leaving a remainder. In this case, the GCD is 11.

Step 7: To find the greatest number of groups Daniel can display, we divide the total number of plates and spoons by the GCD.

Step 8: For plates: 44 / 11 = 4 (with a remainder of 0).
For spoons: 33 / 11 = 3 (with a remainder of 0).

Step 9: Since the remainders are zero, Daniel can display 4 groups of plates and 3 groups of spoons.

Step 1: To make all the pieces of ribbon the same length, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two lengths.

Step 2: The GCD of 8 and 16 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm:

   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number: 16 / 8 = 2 remainder 0
   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder: 8 / 0 (since the remainder is 0, we are done)

   So, the GCD of 8 and 16 is 8.

Step 3: Since the GCD is the greatest length that can be made from both pieces of ribbon without any left over, the final answer is \boxed{8}.",The answer is 8,"Amanda has two pieces of ribbon, one 8 inches long and the other 16 inches long.

Step 1: We want to find the greatest number of identical bouquets the florist can make without any leftover flowers.

Step 2: To do this, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of tulips and the number of carnations.

Step 3: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. First, we find the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number:

18 (carnations) / 12 (tulips) = 1 remainder 6

Step 4: Then, we repeat the process with the smaller number and the remainder:

12 (remainder) / 6 (smaller number) = 2 remainder 0

Since there is no remainder in the last division, the GCD is the divisor, which is 2.

Step 5: The florist can create \boxed{2} identical bouquets with the given number of flowers.",The answer is 6,"A florist has 12 tulips and 18 carnations. If the florist wants to create identical bouquets without any leftover flowers, what is the greatest number of bouquets the florist can make?"
answer = 3,7,"

Step 1: First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of male students and the number of female students.

Step 2: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let's start with the larger number, which is the number of male students (14). We subtract the number of female students (7) from the number of male students:

14 - 7 = 7

Now, we repeat the process with the new number (7) and the original number of female students (7):

7 - 7 = 0

Since the result is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero number we found, which is 7.

Step 3: Now that we have the GCD, we can determine the number of teams by dividing the total number of students by the GCD.

Total students = Male students + Female students
Total students = 14 + 7 = 21

Number of teams = Total students / GCD
Number of teams = 21 / 7

Number of teams = 3 with a remainder of 0

Step 4: Since there is no remainder, we can form exactly 3 teams with the given conditions.

Step 1: We want to find the greatest number of identical bouquets Carmen can create without any lollipops left over.

Step 2: Let's list the number of each type of lollipop Carmen has:
- Cherry lollipops: 4
- Orange lollipops: 6

Step 3: To create identical bouquets, we need to use the same number of each type of lollipop in each bouquet.

Step 4: Let x be the number of cherry lollipops in each bouquet, and y be the number of orange lollipops in each bouquet.

Step 5: We know that x + y = 4 (for cherry lollipops) and x + y = 6 (for orange lollipops).

Step 6: Since we want to find the greatest number of identical bouquets, we'll look for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 6. The GCD of 4 and 6 is 2.

Step 7: So, we can have x = 2 and y = 2 for each bouquet. This means Carmen can create \boxed{2} identical lollipop bouquets.

Step 8: To check if there are any lollipops left over, we can add the number of lollipops in each bouquet:
- For cherry lollipops: 2 + 2 = 4 (which is the total number of cherry lollipops)
- For orange lollipops: 2 + 2 = 4 (which is less than the total number of orange lollipops, but since we've used all the cherry lollipops, this is acceptable)

Step 9: Therefore, Carmen can create \boxed{2} identical lollipop bouquets without any lollipops left over.",The answer is 2,"Carmen is creating lollipop bouquets using 4 cherry lollipops and 6 orange lollipops.

Step 1: Let x be the number of bookshelves Allie uses.
Step 2: Let y be the number of books on each bookshelf.
Step 3: Allie has a total of 5 + 10 = \boxed{15} books.
Step 4: Since each bookshelf must have the same combination of math and science books, we can write the equation: 5x = 2y.
Step 5: We also know that y must be greater than or equal to 1 (since each bookshelf must have at least one book).
Step 6: We want to find the greatest value of x that satisfies the equation.
Step 7: To do this, we can start testing values of x and see which one gives us the smallest value of y that is still greater than or equal to 1.
Step 8: If x = 1, then y = 5, which is not greater than or equal to 1.
Step 9: If x = 2, then y = 2.5, which is not an integer.
Step 10: If x = 3, then y = 1.67, which is not an integer.
Step 11: If x = 4, then y = 1.25, which is not an integer.

Step 1: We want to find the greatest number of portions Kiera can make without any bags left over.

Step 2: To do this, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of bags of nuts (16) and the number of bags of dried fruit (6).

Step 3: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Start by finding the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number. Then, repeat the process with the smaller number and the remainder until the remainder is 0. The last non-remainder is the GCD.

Step 4: Let's apply the Euclidean algorithm:
- Remainder when 16 is divided by 6: 4
- Remainder when 6 is divided by 4: 2

answer: Jeremy should cut each piece of wood into lengths of 18 inches.,18,"

Step 1: To find the common length of the smaller pieces, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two lengths.

Step 2: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. Let's denote the two lengths as a and b, where a = 90 and b = 72.

Step 3: We start by finding the remainder when a is divided by b:

   Remainder = a mod b
   = 90 mod 72
   = 18

Step 4: Now we swap the roles of a and b, and repeat the process with the new values of a and the remainder:

   a = b
   b = Remainder
   Remainder = a mod b
   = 72 mod 18

Step 1: First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of bus tickets and subway tickets.

Step 2: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let's denote the number of bus tickets as b and the number of subway tickets as s.

   b = 18
   s = 12

   We find the remainder when b is divided by s:
   r = b mod s = 6

   Then we swap the roles of b and s:
   b = s
   s = r

   We repeat the process until r is zero:
   s = 6
   r = s mod b = 0

   So the GCD of 18 and 12 is 6.

Step 3: Now we know that the number of tickets in each envelope should be a multiple of 6. To find the greatest number of envelopes, we divide the total number of tickets by the GCD:

Step 1: Determine the total number of items Veronica has.
Total items = Bottles of water + Cans of food
Total items = 20 + 12
Total items = \boxed{32}

Step 2: To find the greatest number of kits Veronica can make, we need to find the largest number of kits that can evenly divide the total number of items.

Step 3: To do this, we can start by finding the largest factor that is less than or equal to the square root of the total number of items.
Square root of total items = Square root of 32
Square root of 32 = 5.656854249492381
Since the square root is not a whole number, the largest factor that is less than or equal to the square root is 5.

Step 4: Now, we can test the multiples of 5 starting from 5 to see which one is a factor of 32.
5 * 6 = 30 (not a factor)
5 * 7 = 35 (not a factor)
5 * 6 = 30 (not a factor)
5 * 6 = 30 (not a factor)
5 * 7 = 35 (not a factor)
5 * 6 = 30 (not a factor)
5 * 7 = 35 (not a factor)
5 * 8 = 40 (not a factor)

Since none of the multiples of 5 are factors of 32, we can conclude that the greatest number of kits Veronica can make is 6.

Step 1: First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls and the number of boys.

Step 2: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let's denote the number of girls as g and the number of boys as b.

   g = 40
   b = 32

   Since g > b, we can divide g by b and get a quotient q and a remainder r:

   q = g / b = 40 / 32 = 1 remainder 8

   Now we swap the roles of g and b:

   g = b = 32
   b = r = 8

   Again, we divide g by b and get a quotient q and a remainder r:

   q = g / b = 32 / 8 = 4 remainder 0

   Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last divisor we found, which is 4.

Step 1: Let's denote the number of adults as A and the number of children as C. Since there are the same number of adults as children, we have A = C.

Step 2: We know that adults are seated in groups of exactly 17 and children are seated in groups of exactly 15. Let's find the largest multiple of 17 that is less than or equal to the largest multiple of 15.

   - The largest multiple of 17 less than or equal to 100 is 102 (since 102 - 17 = 85, which is a multiple of 15).
   - The largest multiple of 15 less than or equal to 100 is 105 (since 105 - 15 = 90, which is a multiple of 17).

Step 3: Since we want the minimum number of adults, we should choose the smaller of the two numbers found in step 2. So, we choose the largest multiple of 17 that is less than or equal to 100, which is 102.

Step 4: To find the number of adults, we divide the chosen number by the number of adults per group, which is 17. So, A = 102 / 17 ≈ 6.06. Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

Step 5: Since A = C, the number of children is also 7.

7 Vitamin A supplements and 17 Vitamin D supplements,119,"

Step 1: Since the store sold equal quantities of Vitamin A and Vitamin D supplements, we can represent the number of Vitamin A supplements as x and the number of Vitamin D supplements as y.

Step 2: We know that the number of packs of Vitamin A supplements is x, and each pack contains 7 supplements. So, the total number of Vitamin A supplements is 7x.

Step 3: Similarly, the number of packs of Vitamin D supplements is y, and each pack contains 17 supplements. So, the total number of Vitamin D supplements is 17y.

Step 4: Since the store sold equal quantities of both types of supplements, we can set up the equation: 7x = 17y.

Step 5: To find the smallest number of each type that the store could have sold, we want to find the smallest positive integers x and y that satisfy the equation.

Step 6: To do this, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 17, which is 1. This means that x and y must both be multiples of 1.

Step 7: Since 7 and 17 are relatively prime (i.e., their GCD is 1), the smallest positive integers x and y that satisfy the equation are x = 1 and y = 1.

Step 8: With x = 1, the number of Vitamin A supplements is 7x = 7.

"Amanda's band could have performed 18 songs, and Sadie's band could have performed 18 songs.",18,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of songs Amanda's band played as A and the number of songs Sadie's band played as S.

Step 2: Since Amanda's band plays songs in sets of 2, the number of sets they played is A/2.

Step 3: Similarly, since Sadie's band plays songs in sets of 9, the number of sets they played is S/9.

Step 4: Since both bands played the same number of songs, we can write the equation: A = 2 * (A/2) = 2 * S/9

Step 5: To find the smallest number of songs each band could have performed, we need to find the smallest integer values for A and S that satisfy the equation.

Step 6: We can start by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 9, which is 18. Let's try A = 18 and S = 18.

Step 7: Plugging these values into the equation, we get: 18 = 2 * (18/2) = 2 * (18/9)

Step 8: Since both sides of the equation are equal, this is a valid solution.

Step 9: To confirm that this is the smallest number of songs each band could have performed, we can check if there are smaller integer values for A and S that satisfy the equation. However, since the LCM of 2 and 9 is 18, there are no smaller integer values for A and S that would work.

Final answer: \boxed{Amanda's band could have performed 18 songs, and Sadie's band could have performed 18 songs.}",The answer is 18,"Amanda and Sadie each have a band. Amanda's band plays songs in sets of 2 and Sadie's band plays songs in sets of 9. After performing together, both bands realize that they have played the same number of songs.

answer: Linda should buy 30 pieces of strawberry gum and 30 pieces of blueberry gum.,30,"

Step 1: To find the smallest number of pieces of each flavor that Linda must buy, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of pieces in each pack.

Step 2: The LCM of 6 and 5 can be found using the prime factorization method.

   - For 6, the prime factors are 2 and 3.
   - For 5, the prime factor is 5.

Step 3: Multiply the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either factor.

   - The highest power of 2 is 1 (since 2 is not a factor of 5).
   - The highest power of 3 is 1 (since 3 is a factor of 6).
   - The highest power of 5 is 1 (since 5 is a factor of 5).

Step 4: Multiply the exponents together to get the LCM.

"answer: Gabe walks 10 pets, and Steven walks 10 pets.",10,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of pets Gabe walks as x and the number of pets Steven walks as y.

Step 2: Since Gabe walks pets in groups of 2, the total number of groups he walks is x/2.

Step 3: Similarly, since Steven walks pets in groups of 10, the total number of groups he walks is y/10.

Step 4: Since they are walking the same total number of pets, we can write an equation: x/2 = y/10.

Step 5: To find the smallest total number of pets, we want to find the smallest possible values for x and y that satisfy the equation. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 10, which is 20.

Step 6: Multiply both sides of the equation by 20 to eliminate the fractions: 20(x/2) = 20(y/10).

Step 7: Simplify the equation: 10x = 2y.

Step 8: Since we want the smallest possible values, let's start by finding the smallest possible value for y. The smallest possible value for y is 1, because any smaller value would not be a whole number.

Step 9: Substitute y = 1 into the equation: 10x = 2(1).

Step 10: Solve for x: x = 10.

Step 11: So, Gabe walks 10 pets (in groups of 2), and Steven walks 10 pets (in groups of 10).

Step 1: To find the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of slices in each package.

Step 2: The GCD of 12 and 28 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm:

   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number: 28 / 12 = 2 remainder 4
   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder: 12 / 4 = 3 remainder 0

Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last number used as the larger number, which is 12.

Step 3: Now that we have the GCD, we can find the smallest number of each type of cheese that Randy could have bought by dividing the total number of slices by the GCD.

   - Total number of slices: 12 (cheddar) + 28 (Swiss) = 40 slices
   - Smallest number of each type: 40 / 12 = \boxed{3.33333333333}

However, since Randy can't buy a fraction of a slice, we need to find the smallest integer value that is a multiple of both 12 and 28. The smallest such number is 28 (which is a multiple of 12 and the number of slices in a single package of Swiss cheese).

So, the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought is \boxed{28} slices of cheddar cheese and \boxed{28} slices of Swiss cheese.",The answer is 84,"Packages of cheddar cheese come with 12 slices, while packages of Swiss cheese come with 28 slices.

Step 1: To find the smallest number of crackers that Karen can pack, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5 and 7.

Step 2: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Start with the larger number (7) and subtract the smaller number (5) repeatedly until the remainder is 0.

7 - 5 = 2
5 - 2 = 3
3 - 2 = 1

The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 1.

Step 3: Since Karen bags the crackers in groups of 7, the smallest number of crackers she can pack is a multiple of the GCD (1). However, since Karen also bags pretzels in groups of 5, the smallest number of crackers she can pack must also be a multiple of 5. The smallest number that is a multiple of both 1 and 5 is 5.

Final answer: \boxed{5} is the smallest number of crackers that Karen can pack.",The answer is 35,Karen is packing equal quantities of pretzels and crackers for snacks. Karen bags the pretzels in groups of 5 and the crackers in groups of 7. What is the smallest number of crackers that she can pack?

Step 1: Let x be the number of muffins sold.

Step 2: Since the bakery sold the same number of muffins and cookies, let y be the number of cookies sold.

Step 3: We know that the bakery sells muffins in packages of 18 and cookies in packages of 5.

Step 4: To find the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold, we want to minimize x while ensuring that x is a multiple of 18 and x = y.

Step 5: Since y is also a multiple of 5, the smallest possible value for y is 5 (the smallest multiple of 5).

Step 6: To find the smallest possible value for x, we need to find the smallest multiple of 18 that is equal to 5.

Step 7: The smallest multiple of 18 that is also a multiple of 5 is 90 (since 90 = 18 * 5).

Step 8: However, this value is too large because it exceeds the number of muffins in a package (18).

Step 9: To find a smaller value, we can look for the smallest multiple of 18 that is less than 18 and also a multiple of 5.

Step 10: The smallest multiple of 18 that is also a multiple of 5 is 10 (since 10 = 18 / 1.8 and 10 is a multiple of 5).

Step 11: Since x = y, the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold is 10.

Final answer: \boxed{10} muffins.",The answer is 90,"Irene's Bakery sells muffins in packages of 18 and cookies in packages of 5.

LCM = 3^2 * 19 = 162

Step 3: Determine the smallest number of roses the customer will have to buy from each vendor.
Since the customer wants to buy the same number of roses from both vendors, we can divide the LCM by the number of roses sold by each vendor and find the smallest number that results in an integer for both vendors.

- For Martha's Blossoms: 162 / 9 = 18 (remainder 0)
- For Rachel's Blooms: 162 / 19 = 8 (remainder 12)

Since the customer wants the same number of roses from both vendors, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both 9 and 19.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many full compartments there are. To do this, we divide the total number of pieces of luggage by the number of pieces each compartment can hold.

   Full compartments = Total luggage / Luggage per compartment
   = 41 / 5
   = 8 (with a remainder of 1)

2. Since there are 8 full compartments, there must be one compartment that isn't full.

3. To find out how many pieces of luggage are in the compartment that isn't full, we subtract the number of pieces in the full compartments from the total number of pieces.

   Luggage in the non-full compartment = Total luggage - Luggage in full compartments
   = 41 - (8 * 5)
   = 41 - 40

= \boxed{9 coats per box}

Step 2: Now, we check if the number of coats is divisible by the number of boxes. If it is, then there are no extra coats.

Since 29 is not divisible by 3, there must be extra coats.

Step 3: To find the number of extra coats, we subtract the number of coats per box from the total number of coats.

Extra coats = Total coats - (Coats per box * Number of boxes)
= 29 coats - (9 coats * 3 boxes)
= 29 coats - 27 coats
= \boxed{2 coats}

Step 5: Since we want the same number of movies on both shelves, we set the number of movies on the first shelf equal to the number of movies on the second shelf:

Step 6: 9 = x

Step 7: However, we are asked to find the difference in the number of movies between the two shelves. So, we subtract the number of movies on the first shelf from the total number of movies:

Step 8: Total number of movies - number of movies on the first shelf = x - 9

Step 9: x - 9 = x (since the second shelf has the same number of movies as the first shelf)

Step 10: Solving for x, we get x = 9

Step 11: Since we are asked to find the difference in the number of movies between the two shelves, we subtract the number of movies on the first shelf from the number of movies on the second shelf:

Step 12: x - 9 = 0 (since the number of movies on both shelves is the same)

Step 13: Solving for x, we get x = 9

Step 14: The owner needs 0 more movies to make sure each shelf has the same number of movies.

\boxed{answer = 0}",The answer is 1,"A movie store had 9 movies they were putting on 2 shelves. If the owner wanted to make sure each shelf had the same number of movies, how many more movies would he need?"
answer = 3 more tickets are needed,3,"

Step 1: Determine the number of friends.
Number of friends = 6

Step 2: Determine the number of tickets each friend has.
Tickets per friend = Total tickets / Number of friends
Tickets per friend = 27 / 6
Tickets per friend = 4.5

Since it's not possible to divide the tickets equally with the current number of tickets, we need to find out how many more tickets are needed to make it an even distribution.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the actual number of tickets per friend and the desired number of tickets per friend (which is an integer).
Difference = Actual tickets per friend - Desired tickets per friend
Difference = 4.5 - 4
Difference = 0.5

Step 4: Since we need to add this difference to the total number of tickets, we can find out how many more tickets are needed by multiplying the difference by the number of friends.
Additional tickets needed = Difference * Number of friends
Additional tickets needed = 0.5 * 6
Additional tickets needed = 3

Step 5: Provide the final answer in \boxed{answer} format.
\boxed{answer = 3 more tickets are needed}",The answer is 3,"At the carnival, 6 friends bought 27 tickets. If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many pictures each exhibit should have if they are to be equal.

Number of pictures in one exhibit = Total pictures / Number of exhibits
Number of pictures in one exhibit = 15 / 2
Number of pictures in one exhibit = \boxed{7.5}

Step 2: Since we cannot have half a picture, we need to find out how many more pictures are needed to make it an integer value.

Additional pictures needed = Ceiling(Number of pictures in one exhibit) - Number of pictures in one exhibit
Additional pictures needed = Ceiling(7.5) - 7
Additional pictures needed = 8 - 7
Additional pictures needed = \boxed{1}

So, the art museum would need 1 more picture to make sure each exhibit has the same amount.",The answer is 1,An art museum had 15 pictures to split equally into 2 different exhibits. How many more pictures would they need to make sure each exhibit had the same amount?

Final answer: \boxed{Luke needs 1 more piece of candy.}",The answer is 1,"Luke had 9 pieces of candy. If he wants to split the candy into 2 bags with the same amount of candy in each bag, how many more pieces would he need to make sure each bag had the same amount?"
answer: There are no extra donuts.,6,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many donuts should be in each box if they are evenly distributed.
Total donuts = 48
Number of boxes = 7

Donuts per box = Total donuts / Number of boxes
Donuts per box = 48 / 7
Donuts per box = 6.857 (rounded to 7 donuts since we can't have a fraction of a donut)

Step 2: Now, let's check if there are any extra donuts after distributing them evenly among the boxes.

Extra donuts = Total donuts - (Donuts per box * Number of boxes)
Extra donuts = 48 - (7 * 7)
Extra donuts = 48 - 49
Extra donuts = -1

Since the number of donuts is less than the number of boxes, there are no extra donuts. The baker distributed the donuts evenly among the boxes without any leftovers.

\boxed{answer: There are no extra donuts.}",The answer is 6,A baker had 7 boxes for donuts. He ended up making 48 donuts and splitting them evenly between the boxes. How many extra donuts did he end up with?
answer = 2,2,"

Step 1: Determine the number of pieces per friend.
To do this, divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends.
\boxed{17 / 5 = 3.4}

Step 2: Since we cannot give a fraction of a piece, we need to find the greatest integer less than or equal to the result from step 1.
This is called the floor function, denoted as \lfloor \rfloor.
\boxed{\lfloor 3.4 \rfloor = 3}

Step 3: Subtract the number of pieces given to the friends from the total number of pieces.
\boxed{17 - 3 * 5 = 17 - 15 = 2}

So, George would have 2 pieces left over.

\boxed{answer = 2}",The answer is 2,"George bought 17 pieces of candy to give to 5 of his friends. If he wants to give each friend the same amount, how many pieces would he have left over?"

Beads per necklace = 31 / 4
Beads per necklace = 7.75

Step 3: Since we cannot have a fraction of a bead, we will round down to the nearest whole number.
Beads per necklace = 7

Step 4: Multiply the number of beads per necklace by the number of necklaces to find the total number of beads used.
Total beads used = Beads per necklace * Number of necklaces
Total beads used = 7 * 4
Total beads used = 28

Step 5: Subtract the total number of beads used from the total number of beads to find the number of beads left over.
Beads left over = Total beads - Total beads used
Beads left over = 31 - 28
Beads left over = \boxed{3}

Step 1: We know the formula for the area of a right angled triangle is given by:
Area = (1/2) * base * height

Step 2: We are given the area (32 sq. cm) and the base (8 cm). So, we can rewrite the formula as:
32 = (1/2) * 8 * height

Step 3: Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
64 = 8 * height

Step 4: Divide both sides by 8:
height = 64 / 8

Step 5: Simplify the right side:
height = 8

42 cm,7,"

Step 1: First, let's find the length of one side of the hexagon. Since the perimeter of a regular hexagon is 6 times the length of one side, we can calculate the length of one side as follows:

Perimeter = 6 * Side length
42 cm = 6 * Side length
Side length = 42 cm / 6
Side length = \boxed{7 cm}

Step 2: Now that we know the length of one side, we can find the length of the ribbon required to border each side. Since the ribbon borders each side, the length of ribbon required for one side is equal to the length of one side:

Ribbon length per side = Side length
Ribbon length per side = 7 cm

Step 3: Since there are 6 sides in a hexagon, we can find the total length of ribbon required by multiplying the ribbon length per side by the number of sides:

Total ribbon length = Ribbon length per side * Number of sides
Total ribbon length = 7 cm * 6
Total ribbon length = \boxed{42 cm}

So, the length of ribbon required to border each side of the hexagonal display board is 7 cm, and the total length of ribbon required is 42 cm.",The answer is 7,The perimeter of a hexagonal display board is 42 cm.

362 ft,90,"

Step 1: First, let's find the width of the equilateral triangle (let's call it x). Since the width of the rectangle and the side of the equilateral triangle are equal, we have:

x = 42 ft

Step 2: Now, let's find the length of the rectangle (let's call it y). We know that the width is 42 ft, and the length is 76 ft:

y = 76 ft

Step 3: The perimeter of the rectangle is the sum of its four sides:

Perimeter of rectangle = 2 * (width + length)
                                      = 2 * (42 ft + 76 ft)
                                      = 2 * 118 ft
                                      = \boxed{236 ft}

Step 4: The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter of equilateral triangle = 3 * side
                                                     = 3 * 42 ft
                                                     = \boxed{126 ft}

Step 5: To find the perimeter of the field, we add the perimeters of the rectangle and the equilateral triangle:

Perimeter of field = Perimeter of rectangle + Perimeter of equilateral triangle
                                 = 236 ft + 126 ft
                                 = \boxed{362 ft}

Step 1: First, let's find out the total number of students who went on the trip.
Total students = 396

Step 2: We know that four students traveled in cars, so the number of students who traveled by bus is the total number of students minus the number of students who traveled in cars.
Students by bus = Total students - Students in cars
= 396 - 4
= 392

Step 3: Since all seven buses were filled, the number of students per bus is the total number of students by bus divided by the number of buses.
Students per bus = Students by bus / Number of buses
= 392 / 7

Step 4: To find the number of students per bus as a decimal, we can divide 392 by 7.
Students per bus (decimal) = 392 / 7
= 56.0

Step 5: To find the number of students per bus as a whole number, we round the decimal to the nearest whole number.
Since 56.0 is greater than 50, we round up to 57.

Step 2: We know that the total number of students is 650, so:

B + G = 650

Step 3: We also know that there are 106 more girls than boys, so:

G = B + 106

Step 4: Now we have two equations with two variables:

1) B + G = 650
2) G = B + 106

Step 5: To solve this system of equations, we can substitute the second equation into the first one:

B + (B + 106) = 650

Step 3: After 15 years, the children's ages will be C + 15 and the father's age will be F + 15.

Step 4: At that time, the sum of the children's ages will be (C + 15) * 5 (since there are 5 children).

Step 5: We also know that after 15 years, the sum of the children's ages will be twice the father's age, so we can write the equation: (C + 15) * 5 = 2(F + 15).

Step 6: Substitute F from the first equation into the second equation: (C * 5 + 15) * 5 = 2(C * 5 + 15 + 15).

"F = 6, O = 4, Y = 2",21,"

Step 1: Let's denote the father's present age as F, the older son's present age as O, and the younger son's present age as Y.

Step 2: Ten years ago, the older son's age was O - 10 and the younger son's age was Y - 10.

Step 3: The sum of their ages ten years ago was (O - 10) + (Y - 10) = F/3 (since it was one-third of their father's age at that time).

Step 4: Now, the sum of their present ages is O + Y = F - 14 (since it is 14 years less than the father's present age).

Step 5: We have two equations with three variables:

   Equation 1: (O - 10) + (Y - 10) = F/3
   Equation 2: O + Y = F - 14

Step 6: To eliminate one variable, let's add Equation 1 and Equation 2:

   (O - 10) + (Y - 10) + O + Y = F/3 + F - 14

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

   2(O + Y) = F/3 + F - 14 + 20

Step 8: Divide both sides by 2:

   O + Y = (F + 6)/3

Step 9: Now, we have one equation with two variables:

   O + Y = (F + 6)/3

Step 10: Since the older son is two years older than the younger son, we can write Y = O - 2.

Step 11: Substitute Y in the equation from Step 9:

   O + (O - 2) = (F + 6)/3

Step 12: Solve for O:

   2O - 2 = (F + 6)/3
   2O = F + 8
   O = (F + 8)/2

Step 13: Substitute O in the equation for Y:

   Y = (F + 8)/2 - 2

Step 14: Now, we have two equations with two variables:

   Equation 1: (O - 10) + (Y - 10) = F/3
   Equation 2: O = (F + 8)/2

Step 15: Solve Equation 1 for Y:

   Y = F/3 - O + 10

Step 16: Substitute O from Equation 2 in the equation for Y:

   Y = F/3 - ((F + 8)/2) + 10

Step 17: Solve for F:

   F/3 - (F + 8)/2 + 10 = Y
   F/3 - F/2 + 8/2 + 10 = Y
   F(2/6 - 1/2) + 8/2 + 10 = Y
   F(1/3) + 8/2 + 10 = Y

Step 18: Now, we have an equation for Y:

   Y = F(1/3) + 8/2 + 10

Step 19: Substitute Y from Equation 2 in the equation for Y:

   (F + 8)/2 = F(1/3) + 8/2 + 10

Step 20: Solve for F:

   F(1/3) = (F + 8)/2 - 10
   F(1/3) = (2F + 16 - 6F - 20)/2
   F(1/3) = (F - 4)/2
   F^2 - 4F - 12 = 0

Step 21: Factor the quadratic equation:

   (F - 6)(F + 2) = 0

Step 22: Solve for F:

   F = 6 or F = -2

Step 23: Since the father's age cannot be negative, the father's present age is 6 years.

Step 24: Now, we can find the sons' Therefore, the answer is \boxed{F = 6, O = 4, Y = 2}.",The answer is 21,"Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age.

Step 1: Let the tens digit be $a$ and the units digit be $b$.

Step 2: According to the problem, the number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits.

Step 3: So, $10a + b = 4(a + b)$ and $10a \cdot b = 2(a \cdot b)$.

Step 4: Simplifying the first equation, we get $a + b = \frac{10a + b}{4} \Rightarrow 3a + 3b = 10a + b$.

Step 5: Rearranging the terms, we get $6a + 2b = 0$.

Step 6: Simplifying the second equation, we get $a^2b = 5ab$.

Step 7: Dividing both sides by $ab$, we get $a = 5$.

Step 8: Substituting $a = 5$ in the equation $6a + 2b = 0$, we get $30 + 2b = 0 \Rightarrow 2b = -30 \Rightarrow b = -15$.

Step 1: Let the two digits of the number be $a$ and $b$. So, the number is $10a + b$.

Step 2: According to the problem, $10a + b = 7(a + b)$. Solving this equation for $a$ and $b$, we get $a = 3$ and $b = 4$.

Step 3: When $27$ is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. So, $10a + b - 27 = 10b + a$. Substituting the values of $a$ and $b$ from step 2, we get $10(3) + 4 - 27 = 10(4) + 3$. Solving this equation, we get $b = 7$ and $a = 1$.

Step 4: However, we made a mistake in step 2. The correct equation should be $100a + 10b + b = 7(a + b + 10b)$. Solving this equation for $a$ and $b$, we get $a = 3$ and $b = 4$. But when we interchange the digits and subtract $27$, we get $10b + a - 27 = 10a + b$. Substituting the values of $a$ and $b$ from step 2, we get $10(4) + 3 - 27 = 10(3) + 4$. This equation is not true.

Step 5: Let's try another approach. Let the two digits of the number be $a$ and $b$. So, the number is $10a + b$. When $27$ is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. So, $10a + b - 27 = 10b + a$. Solving this equation for $a$ and $b$, we get $a = 3$ and $b = 4$. But when we substitute these values in the original equation $10a + b = 7(a + b)$, we get $30 + 4 = 7(3 + 4)$, which is not true.

Step 6: Let's try one more approach. Let the two digits of the number be $a$ and $b$. So, the number is $10a + b$. When $27$ is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. So, $10a + b - 27 = 10b + a$. Solving this equation for $a$ and $b$, we get $a = 3$ and $b = 4$. But when we substitute these values in the original equation $10a + b = 7(a + b)$, we get $30 + 4 = 7(3 + 4 + 10)$, which is not true.

(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 9

Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we get:
9a - 9b = 9

Step 6: Dividing both sides by 9, we have:
a - b = 1

Step 7: Since a + b = 9, we can write the equation as:
2a = 10

Step 8: Solving for a, we get:
a = 5

Step 9: Substituting the value of a in the equation a + b = 9, we get:
5 + b = 9

Step 10: Solving for b, we get:
b = 4

Step 11: So, the two digit number is \boxed{54}.",The answer is 45,"In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9. Find the number."
159,96,"

Step 1: Let's denote the two digits as A and B. We know that the sum of the digits is 15, so A + B = 15.

Step 2: The number is decreased by 27, so the new number is the reversed number minus 27. Let's denote the reversed number as 10B + A.

Step 3: Since the number is decreased by 27, we have the equation: 10B + A - 27 = reversed number.

Step 4: To find the reversed number, we just need to reverse the digits: A and B. So, the reversed number is BA.

Step 5: Now, we can rewrite the equation in terms of BA: 10B + A - 27 = BA.

Step 6: Since A and B are single digits, we can say that A = 1, 2, ..., 9 and B = 0, 1, ..., 8 (excluding A = B). We need to find the solutions for this equation for each possible pair of A and B.

Step 7: Let's start with A = 1. We have the equation: 10B + 1 - 27 = B1. Solving this equation gives B = 6. So, the pair (A, B) is (1, 6).

Step 8: Now, let's try A = 2. We have the equation: 10B + 2 - 27 = B2. Solving this equation gives no integer solution for B.

Step 9: Let's try A = 3. We have the equation: 10B + 3 - 27 = B3. Solving this equation gives B = 4. So, the pair (A, B) is (3, 4).

Step 10: We continue this process for all possible values of A and B. After checking all the possibilities, we find that the only solutions are (A, B) = (1, 6) and (A, B) = (3, 4).

Step 11: Since we are looking for the original number, we need to find the number that, when its digits are reversed, gives one of the solutions we found. The reversed numbers for the solutions are 61 and 43.

Step 12: The only two-digit number that, when its digits are reversed, gives one of these numbers is 36 (since 36 reversed is 63, but we are looking for a two-digit number, so we discard this one). The other number that, when its digits are reversed, gives 61 is 16.

Step 13: However, if we decrease 16 by 27, we get -11, which is not a two-digit number. The only remaining possibility is the number 61. But when we decrease 61 by 27, we get -16, which is not a two-digit number either.

Step 14: We made a mistake in our calculations. The number 16, when decreased by 27, gives the two-digit number 159 (since 16 - 27 = -11, and the two-digit number with the same digits but in reverse order is 91, and 91 + 100 = 159).

Step 15: So, the final answer is \boxed{159}.",The answer is 96,The sum of the digits of a two number is 15. The number is decreased by 27 the digits are reversed. Find the number.
907,93,"

Step 1: Let's denote the tens digit as T and the units digit as U. According to the problem, T = 3U.

Step 2: The number is a two-digit number, so the sum of the digits is between 10 and 99. The sum of the digits of the original number is T + U. Since T = 3U, the sum of the digits is 3U + U = 4U.

Step 3: The number decreased by 54 is the reversed number. So, the reversed number is the original number + 54. The reversed number is U + 10T.

Step 4: Since the digits are reversed, we have U + 10T = T + U + 54. Substituting T = 3U, we get U + 10(3U) = T + U + 54.

Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we get U + 30U = 4U + 54. Solving for U, we find U = 12.

Step 6: Now that we have the units digit, we can find the tens digit using T = 3U. So, T = 3 * 12 = 36.

Step 7: The original number is T tens and U units, so the original number is 36 tens and 12 units, which is 3612.

Step 8: The number decreased by 54 is 3612 - 54 = 3558. Since the digits are reversed, the reversed number is 853.

Step 9: However, the problem states that the reversed number is the original number + 54, not the original number - 54. So, we need to find the number that, when decreased by 54, is 853.

Step 10: To find this number, we add 54 to 853 to get the original number. So, the original number is 853 + 54 = \boxed{907}.

So, the number is \boxed{907}.",The answer is 93,"In a two digit number, the tens digit is three times the unit digit. When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. Find the number."
62,53,"

Step 1: Let the tens digit be $a$ and the units digit be $b$.

Step 2: Since the sum of the digits is 8, we have $a + b = 8$.

Step 3: The number is $10a + b$. The reversed number is $10b + a$.

Step 4: The difference between the number and the reversed number is $18$, so we have $(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 18$.

Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we get $9a - 9b = 18$.

Step 6: Since $a + b = 8$, we can write $a = 8 - b$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get $9(8 - b) - 9b = 18$.

Step 7: Solving for $b$, we find $b = 2$.

Step 8: Substituting $b = 2$ into the equation $a + b = 8$, we find $a = 6$.

Step 9: The number is $10a + b = \boxed{62}$.

The number is \boxed{62}.",The answer is 53,The sum of the digits of a two digit number is 8 and the difference between the number and that formed by reversing the digits is 18. Find the number.

Step 1: Let's denote the fixed charge as F and the charge per kilometer as R.

Step 2: We have two equations based on the given information:

1) F + 10R = 75 (for a journey of 10 km)
2) F + 15R = 110 (for a journey of 15 km)

Step 3: To eliminate the fixed charge F, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:

(F + 15R) - (F + 10R) = 110 - 75
5R = 35

Step 4: Solve for R:
R = 35 / 5 = \boxed{7}

Step 5: Now that we have the charge per kilometer, we can calculate the charge for a journey of 25 km:

answer = x * (4/3),1440,"

Step 1: Let the actual speed of the train be x km/hr.
Let the scheduled time be t hours.

Step 2: If the train were 6 km/hr faster, it would have covered the distance in (t - 8) hours.
So, the distance covered at the faster speed is (x + 6)(t - 8).

Step 3: If the train were 6 km/hr slower, it would have taken (t + 12) hours to cover the distance.
So, the distance covered at the slower speed is (x - 6)(t + 12).

Step 4: Since both speeds cover the same distance, we can set up the equation:
(x + 6)(t - 8) = (x - 6)(t + 12)

Step 5: Expanding the equation, we get:
xt - 8x + 6t - 48 = xt + 12t - 6x - 72

Step 6: Simplifying the equation, we get:
-24 = 18t

Step 7: Solving for t, we get:
t = -24 / 18
t = -4 / 3

Since time cannot be negative, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. However, if we assume that the time is given in fractions of hours, then t = 4/3 hours.

Step 8: Now, we can find the length of the journey by multiplying the time by the actual speed:
Length = x * (4/3)

Step 1: Let's denote the two-digit number as AB, where A is the tens digit and B is the units digit.

Step 2: We know that the sum of the digits is 9, so A + B = 9.

Step 3: Let's find the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits. This number is BA.

Step 4: We are given that nine times the original number is twice the reversed number. So, 9AB = 2BA.

Step 5: Simplify the equation: 9AB = 2BA => AB = (2BA)/9.

Step 6: Substitute A + B = 9 into the equation: AB = (2 * (B + A)) / 9.

Step 7: Solve for A: A = (2 * (B + A)) / 9 - B.

Step 8: Since A and B are digits, A must be between 0 and 9. We can test the possible values of B and find the corresponding A for each B.

Step 9: Testing B = 1, we get A = (2 * (1 + A)) / 9 - 1 => A = 4. So, the number is 41.

Step 10: Testing B = 2, we get A = (2 * (2 + A)) / 9 - 2 => A = 7. So, the number is 72.

Step 11: Testing B = 3, we get A = (2 * (3 + A)) / 9 - 3 => A = 10, which is not a valid digit.

Step 12: Testing B = 4, we get A = (2 * (4 + A)) / 9 - 4 => A = 1. So, the number is 14.

Step 13: Testing B = 5, we get A = (2 * (5 + A)) / 9 - 5 => A = 0, which is not a valid digit.

Step 14: Testing B = 6, we get A = (2 * (6 + A)) / 9 - 6 => A = 3. So, the number is 36.

Step 15: Testing B = 7, we get A = (2 * (7 + A)) / 9 - 7 => A = 2. So, the number is 27.

Step 16: Testing B = 8, we get A = (2 * (8 + A)) / 9 - 8 => A = 5. So, the number is 58.

Step 17: Testing B = 9, we get A = (2 * (9 + A)) / 9 - 9 => A = 6. So, the number is 69.

Step 3: Solving the equation from step 2, we get x = 4y - 4 and y = 5.

Step 4: According to the second condition, when 5 is subtracted from both numerator and denominator, the fraction becomes 1/2. So, (x-5)/(y-5) = 1/2.

Step 3: Cross-multiply the new fraction: (x + 1)(2) = (y + 3).

Step 4: Solve for x: 2x + 2 = 2y + 6.

answer: There are no flowers left for the last vase.,2,"

Step 1: First, we need to find out how many vases the florist needs to fill. To do this, we divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers each vase can hold.

Number of vases = Total flowers / Flowers per vase
= 905 / 7
= 129 with a remainder of 5

So, the florist needs 129 vases to hold all the flowers.

Step 2: Since the vases are being filled equally, the first 129 vases will each have 905 - (129 * 7) = 905 - 903 = 2 extra flowers.

Step 3: The last vase will have the remaining flowers after all the other vases are filled. Since the first 129 vases have 2 extra flowers each, the last vase will have 129 * 2 = 258 extra flowers.

Step 4: Subtract the number of flowers each vase can hold from the total number of extra flowers.

Flowers in the last vase = Extra flowers - (Flowers per vase * Number of vases)
= 258 - (7 * 129)
= 258 - 903
= -664 (This is a negative number, which means there are actually no flowers left.)

Since the number of flowers left is negative, it means that all the flowers have been distributed among the vases. Therefore, there are no flowers left for the last vase.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the problem.
Let x be the number of pieces of paper Carol used in a week.

Initial number of pieces of paper = 81
Number of pieces of paper left after a week = 38

Step 2: Write the equation.
81 - x = 38

Step 3: Solve for x.
Add 81 to both sides of the equation.
81 + 38 = x
119 = x

Step 4: Check the answer.
81 - 119 = -38
Since there are no negative pieces of paper, the answer is incorrect.

Step 5: Find the error in the problem.
The initial number of pieces of paper was 81, but the number of pieces of paper left after a week was 38, which is less than the initial number. This means that Carol must have added some pieces of paper to her folder during the week.

Step 6: Adjust the equation to account for the additional pieces of paper.
Let y be the number of additional pieces of paper Carol added to her folder during the week.

Initial number of pieces of paper = 81 + y
Number of pieces of paper left after a week = 38

Step 7: Write the new equation.
(81 + y) - x = 38

Step 8: Solve for x.
Subtract 81 from both sides of the equation.
y + 81 - x = 38

Step 9: Solve for x.
Add x to both sides of the equation.
x + y + 81 = 38 + x

Step 10: Solve for x.
Subtract y from both sides of the equation.
x = 38 - y

Step 11: Since Carol used some pieces of paper, y must be a positive number.
Let's try a few values for y to find the smallest positive value that makes x a whole number.

If y = 1, then x = 37 - 1 = 36, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 2, then x = 37 - 2 = 35, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 3, then x = 37 - 3 = 34, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 4, then x = 37 - 4 = 33, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 5, then x = 37 - 5 = 32, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 6, then x = 37 - 6 = 31, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 7, then x = 37 - 7 = 30, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 8, then x = 37 - 8 = 29, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 9, then x = 37 - 9 = 28, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 10, then x = 37 - 10 = 27, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 11, then x = 37 - 11 = 26, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 12, then x = 37 - 12 = 25, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 13, then x = 37 - 13 = 24, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 14, then x = 37 - 14 = 23, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 15, then x = 37 - 15 = 22, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 16, then x = 37 - 16 = 21, which is not the number of pieces of paper Carol used.
If y = 17, then x = 37",The answer is 43,Carol had eighty-one pieces of paper in her folder. After a week she had thirty-eight left. How many pieces did she use in the week?

Let's call the number of good games from the garage sale as y.

Step 3: Luke had 2 games that didn't work.

Step 4: Since Luke had 2 bad games, he must have bought 4 games in total (2 from his friend + 2 from the garage sale).
So, x + y = 4

Step 5: Since 2 of the games didn't work, the number of good games is the total number of games minus the number of bad games.

Solution:

1. First, let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls and boys, which will be the number of members in each group.

   GCD(16, 8) = 8

2. Since the president wants to make sure that no one is left out, the number of groups must be less than or equal to the smaller number of members between girls and boys. In this case, the number of girls (16) is greater, so the number of groups can be up to 16.

3. However, we found that the GCD of the number of girls and boys is 8. This means that the president can make groups of 8 members, with 2 girls and 6 boys in each group.

4. To find the greatest number of groups, we divide the total number of members by the number of members in each group.

   Number of groups = Total members / Members per group
   = 16 girls + 8 boys / 8 members per group
   = 24 / 8
   = 3

answer: 9,198," (Assume that both businesses can use any number of trucks to ship their packages.)

Step 1: Let's denote the number of packages each business shipped as S for Sarah and R for Ryan.

Step 2: Since both businesses shipped the same number of packages, we have S = R.

Step 3: To find the minimum number of packages each business must have shipped, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of packages each truck can carry.

Step 4: The LCM of 18 and 11 can be found using the formula LCM(a, b) = |a * b| / GCD(a, b), where GCD(a, b) is the greatest common divisor.

Step 5: Calculate the GCD of 18 and 11:

R = 78 and B = 100,260,"✍️

Step 1: Let's denote the number of red flyers as R and the number of blue flyers as B.

Step 2: Since Tayli gave out the same number of red and blue flyers, we can write the equation: R = B.

Step 3: Now, we know that Tayli gave packs of 13 red flyers to each restaurant owner and sets of 20 blue flyers to each clothing store owner. Let's assume there are R restaurants and B clothing stores.

Step 4: The total number of red flyers given out is 13R (since each restaurant received R packs). Similarly, the total number of blue flyers given out is 20B (since each clothing store received B sets).

Step 5: Since the total number of red and blue flyers is the same, we can write another equation: 13R + 20B = 2(R + B).

Step 6: Now, we have two equations:

  1) R = B
  2) 13R + 20B = 2(R + B)

Step 7: We can substitute R = B into the second equation:

   13B + 20B = 2(2B)

Step 8: Simplify the equation:

   33B = 4B

Step 9: Solve for B:

   33 = 4
   B = 33 / 4

Step 10: Since B is the number of clothing stores, it must be a whole number. The only possible whole number solution for B is 8.25, but since we cannot have a fraction of a store, this solution is not valid.

Step 11: Let's try a different approach. Since 33 is not divisible by 4, let's try to find a multiple of 13 that is also a multiple of 20. The least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 20 is 60. Let's try R = B = 60 / 13 = 4.6153846153846155. Again, this solution is not valid since we cannot have a fraction of a restaurant or store.

Step 12: Let's try another multiple of 13 that is also a multiple of 20. The next multiple of 13 is 26, and the next multiple of 20 is 40. Let's try R = B = 40 / 13 = 3.076923076923077. This solution is not valid since we cannot have a fraction of a restaurant or store.

Step 13: Let's try another multiple of 13 that is also a multiple of 20. The next multiple of 13 is 39, and the next multiple of 20 is 40. Let's try R = 39 and B = 40.

Step 14: Check if the number of red and blue flyers is the same: R = 39 and B = 40. They are not the same.

Step 15: Let's try another multiple of 13 that is also a multiple of 20. The next multiple of 13 is 52, and the next multiple of 20 is 60. Let's try R = 52 and B = 60.

Step 16: Check if the number of red and blue flyers is the same: R = 52 and B = 60. They are not the same.

Step 17: Let's try another multiple of 13 that is also a multiple of 20. The next multiple of 13 is 65, and the next multiple of 20 is 80. Let's try R = 65 and B = 80.

Step 18: Check if the number of red and blue flyers is the same: R = 65 and B = 80. They are not the same.

Step 19: Let's try another multiple of 13 that is also a multiple of 20. The next multiple of 13 is 78, and the next multiple of 20 is 100. Let's try R = 78 and B = 100.

Step 20 Therefore, the answer is \boxed{R = 78 and B = 100}. Tayli distributed 78 packs of red flyers and 100 sets of blue flyers.",The answer is 260,"Tayli wishes to advertise her business, so she gives packs of 13 red flyers to each restaurant owner and sets of 20 blue flyers to each clothing store owner.

18,102," Let x be the number of hand towels and y be the number of bath towels.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total number of towels sold.
x + y = total towels sold

Step 2: Since the total number of towels sold is a multiple of both 17 and 6, we can write the total number of towels as 17a, where a is a positive integer.
x + y = 17a

Step 3: Since the number of hand towels and bath towels are sold in sets, we can write the number of hand towels as 17b, where b is a positive integer, and the number of bath towels as 6c, where c is a positive integer.
x = 17b
y = 6c

Step 4: Substitute the expressions for x and y from step 3 into the equation from step 2.
17b + 6c = 17a

Step 5: Since both sides of the equation are multiples of 17, we can write the equation as:
17(b - a) = 6c

Step 6: Divide both sides of the equation by 17.
b - a = 6c / 17

Step 7: Since b and c are positive integers, we can write 6c as a multiple of 17. The smallest possible multiple of 17 that is greater than or equal to 6 is 17. So, 6c = 17k, where k is a positive integer.
b - a = 17k / 17
b - a = k

Step 8: Since b and a are positive integers, the smallest possible value for b - a is 1. So, k = 1.
b - a = 1

Step 9: Since b is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for b is 2. So, a = b - 1 = 1.

Step 10: Since c is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for c is 1. So, 6c = 17.

Step 11: Solve for c.
c = 17 / 6 ≈ 2.8333
Since c must be a positive integer, the smallest possible value for c is 3.

Step 12: Substitute the values of a, b, and c back into the expressions for x and y.
x = 17b = 17 * 2 = \boxed{34} hand towels
y = 6c = 6 * 3 = \boxed{18} bath towels

The smallest number of each type of towel that the store must have sold is 34 hand towels and 18 bath towels.",The answer is 102,"Hay's Linens sells hand towels in sets of 17 and bath towels in sets of 6.

x + y = 15 + 1 = 16,3,"

Step 1: We have two types of desserts, chocolate cake and cheesecake.

Step 2: Let x be the number of platters with chocolate cake and y be the number of platters with cheesecake.

Step 3: The total number of pieces of chocolate cake must equal the total number of pieces of cheesecake, so we have the equation:

15x = 6y

Step 4: Since we want to prepare the greatest number of platters, we want to maximize the value of x and y.

Step 5: To find the maximum value for x, we can divide 15 by the smallest possible value for y (which is 1, since y must be a positive integer):

15 / 1 = 15

So, the maximum value for x is 15.

Step 6: Now, we can find the corresponding value for y by using the equation from step 3:

15 * 1 = 6y
y = 6 / 15
y = 0.4

Since y must be a positive integer, we round up to the nearest integer:

y = 1

Step 7: So, the greatest number of platters Brant can prepare is \boxed{x + y = 15 + 1 = 16}. However, since Brant cannot have a fraction of a cake, he can only prepare 15 platters (14 with chocolate cake and 1 with cheesecake).",The answer is 3,"In preparation for a party, Brant is putting desserts onto platters.

Solution:

1. Let's first find the speed of each rider. The first rider completes a round in 12 minutes, so his speed is 1 round / 12 minutes = \boxed{\frac{1}{12}} rounds per minute.

2. The second rider completes a round in 18 minutes, so his speed is 1 round / 18 minutes = \boxed{\frac{1}{18}} rounds per minute.

3. To find when they meet again, we need to find a common multiple of their speeds. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 18.

L,72,"

Step 1: First, let's find the total length of the train tracks that Sean and Ruth have combined.
Sean has 8-inch pieces, and he has \boxed{x} number of them.
Ruth has 18-inch pieces, and she has \boxed{y} number of them.

The total length of the train tracks that Sean and Ruth have combined is:
Total length = (8 * x) + (18 * y)

Step 2: Let's assume that they want to build tracks that are equal in length. Let's call the desired length L.

Step 3: Since the lengths of the tracks are equal, the total length of the tracks that Sean and Ruth build together should be the same as the total length of the tracks they currently have.

Step 4: We can set up an equation to represent this situation:
(8 * x) + (18 * y) = L

Step 5: To find the number of each piece that each child needs, we need to solve for x and y in terms of L.

Step 6: First, let's solve for y in terms of L:
y = (L - (8 * x)) / 18

Step 7: Now, let's solve for x in terms of L:
x = (L - (18 * y)) / 8

Step 8: Since we don't know the exact value of L, we can't find the exact number of each piece that each child needs. However, we can express the number of each piece in terms of L.

Step 9: To find the number of 8-inch pieces that Sean needs, we can substitute y from the equation in step 6 into the equation in step 7:
x = (L - (18 * (L - (8 * x)) / 18)) / 8

Step 10: Simplify the equation:
x = (L - 18L/18 + 144x/144) / 8
x = (L - L + 144x/144) / 8
x = 144x / (144L)
x = L / (144L / 144)
x = L / 1

So, Sean needs \boxed{L} 8-inch pieces of train track.

Step 11: To find the number of 18-inch pieces that Ruth needs, we can substitute x from the equation in step 10 into the equation in step 6:
y = (L - (8 * L / 1)) / 18

Step 12: Simplify the equation:
y = (L - L) / 18
y = 0 / 18
y = 0

So, Ruth doesn't need any 18-inch pieces of train track because she already has enough.

In conclusion, Sean needs \boxed{L} 8-inch pieces of train track, and Ruth doesn't need any 18-inch pieces of train track. The exact number of each piece that each child needs depends on the desired length L of the train tracks.",The answer is 72,Sean has 8-inch pieces of toy train track and Ruth has 18-inch pieces of train track. How many of each piece would each child need to build tracks that are equal in length?

Multiples of 100: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, ...
Multiples of 30: 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, ...

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 300. So, the LCM of 100 and 30 is 300.

Step 3: Now, we need to find how many callers must get through before the 300th caller. To do this, we can find the number of callers that need to be skipped between the 100th and 300th callers.

Step 4: Since every 100th caller receives a $100 bill, we can find the number of callers between the 100th and 300th callers by subtracting the number of 100th callers from the number of 300th callers.

Step 5: The number of 100th callers is 3 (since the first 3 callers are not 100th callers), and the number of 300th callers is 3 (since every 300 callers is a 100th caller). So, the number of callers between the 100th and 300th callers is 297 - 3 = 294.

Step 6: Now, we need to find how many callers must get through before the 294th caller also receives free concert tickets. Since every 30th caller receives free concert tickets, we can find the number of callers between the 30th and 294th callers by subtracting the number of 30th callers from the number of 294th callers.

Step 7: The number of 30th callers is 9 (since the first 29 callers are not 30th callers), and the number of 294th callers is 9 (since every 294 callers is a 30th caller). So, the number of callers between the 30th and 294th callers is 294 - 9 = 285.

Step 8: To find the total number of callers that must get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket, we add the number of callers between the 100th and 300th callers (294) and the number of callers between the 30th and 294th callers (285).

Step 9: So, the total number of callers that must get through is 294 + 285 = 579.

\boxed{answer: 579}",The answer is 300,The radio station gave away a $100 bill for every 100th caller. Every 30th caller received free concert tickets. How many callers must get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket?

Step 1: Let x be the number of games that Enzo played.

Step 2: Enzo wins 5 tickets per game, so he won 5x tickets.

Step 3: Beatriz wins 11 tickets per game, so she won 11x tickets.

Step 4: Since Enzo and Beatriz had the same number of total tickets, we can write the equation: 5x = 11x + y, where y is the number of games that Beatriz played.

Step 5: To minimize the number of games that Enzo played, we want to maximize y (the number of games that Beatriz played).

Step 6: Solving the equation for y, we get y = -6x. This means that for every game Enzo plays, Beatriz plays 6 more games.

Step 7: To minimize the number of games that Enzo played, we want to minimize x. However, x cannot be negative because the number of games must be a non-negative integer.

Step 8: If x = 0, then Enzo didn't play any games, which contradicts the problem statement. So, the minimum number of games that Enzo could have played is 1.

Final answer: \boxed{answer = 1}",The answer is 11,"Enzo and Beatriz are playing games at their local arcade. Incredibly, Enzo wins 5 tickets from every game, and Beatriz wins 11 tickets from every game. When they stopped playing games, Enzo and Beatriz had won the same number of total tickets.

Step 1: Let's denote the number of times Miranda goes to the store as M and the number of times Savannah goes to the store as S.

Step 2: The total amount of money Miranda spends is 7M, and the total amount of money Savannah spends is 9S.

Step 3: Since they have spent the exact same total amount of money, we can write the equation: 7M = 9S.

Step 4: To find the least possible number of times Miranda has been to the store, we need to find the smallest integer value for M that satisfies the equation.

Step 5: To find the smallest integer value for M, we can test different values of M and see if there is a corresponding integer value for S that also satisfies the equation.

Step 6: Let's start testing values for M:

- If M = 1, then 7(1) = 7 ≠ 9S for any integer value of S.
- If M = 2, then 7(2) = 14 ≠ 9S for any integer value of S.
- If M = 3, then 7(3) = 21 ≠ 9S for any integer value of S.
- If M = 4, then 7(4) = 28 = 9(3), so M = 4 is the least possible number of times Miranda has been to the store.

Step 2: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. Let's denote the widths of the two pieces of paper as a and b, where a = 44 and b = 33.

Step 3: We start by finding the remainder when a is divided by b:

Remainder = a mod b = 44 mod 33 = 11

Step 4: Now we swap the roles of a and b, and repeat the process with the new values:

New a = b = 33
New b = Remainder = 11
Remainder = b mod a = 11 mod 44 = 11 (since 11 is less than 44, we stop here)

Step 5: The GCD is the last non-zero remainder we found, which is 11.

Step 6: To find the width of each strip, we divide the width of each piece of paper by the GCD:

Width of first piece = 44 / 11 ≈ 4.00
Width of second piece = 33 / 11 ≈ 3.00

Step 7: Since Jazmin wants to cut the paper into strips that are equal in width and are as wide as possible, she should cut each strip to be \boxed{4.00 inches wide}.",The answer is 11,Jazmin is completing an art project. She has two pieces of construction paper. The first piece is 44 inches wide and the second piece is 33 inches wide. Jazmin wants to cut the paper into strips that are equal in width and are as wide as possible. How wide should Jazmin cut each strip?

Solution:

1. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of pencils and calculators. The GCD is the largest number that can evenly divide both numbers.

2. To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let's denote the number of pencils as P and the number of calculators as C.

   - Initially, we set up the equation: P = qC + R, where q is the quotient and R is the remainder.

   - Then, we swap the roles of P and C, and repeat the process with the new values of P and C: C = q'P + R', where q' is the new quotient and R' is the new remainder.

   - We continue this process until R = 0, at which point the GCD is the last non-zero value of C.

   - In this case, P = 72 and C = 24. Let's perform the Euclidean algorithm:

      - 72 = 3 * 24 + 0 (GCD = 24)

   - Since the GCD is already equal to the number of calculators, there is no need to continue the algorithm.

3. However, since we want to find the number of pencils in each package, we need to divide the number of pencils by the GCD:

   - Number of pencils per package = P / GCD = 72 / 24 = \boxed{3}

So, Zayed can create 24 identical packages, each containing 3 pencils.",The answer is 3,"Zayed is helping his classmates get ready for their math test by making them identical packages of pencils and calculators. He has 72 pencils and 24 calculators and he must use all of the pencils and calculators.

Step 1: Let's denote the number of pins that Sam knocks down as S and the number of pins that Carlos knocks down as C.

Step 2: Since Sam knocks down 8 pins on every bowl, the total number of pins that Sam knocks down in a day is 8 times the number of bowls he bowls.

Step 3: Similarly, since Carlos knocks down 9 pins on every bowl, the total number of pins that Carlos knocks down in a day is 9 times the number of bowls he bowls.

Step 4: We know that Sam and Carlos have knocked down the same total number of pins. So, we can write the equation: 8S = 9C

Step 5: To find the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 9. The LCM of 8 and 9 is 72.

Step 6: Now, we can find the least number of bowls that Sam and Carlos could have bowled by dividing the LCM by the smaller of the two numbers (8).

Step 7: The least number of bowls that Sam and Carlos could have bowled is 72 / 8 = \boxed{9}.

Step 8: Since Sam knocks down 8 pins on every bowl, the least number of pins that Sam could have knocked down is 8 * 9 = \boxed{72}.

Step 9: Similarly, since Carlos knocks down 9 pins on every bowl, the least number of pins that Carlos could have knocked down is 9 * 9 = \boxed{81}.

So, the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down is 72 (for Sam) and 81 (for Carlos).",The answer is 72,"Sam and Carlos are bowling with plastic pins in Sam's living room. Remarkably, Sam knocks down 8 pins on every bowl, and Carlos knocks down 9 pins on every bowl. At the end of the day, Sam and Carlos have knocked down the same total number of pins.

5 guards on each team,5,"

Step 1: First, let's find the total number of players in the league.
Total players = Forwards + Guards
Total players = 32 + 80
Total players = \boxed{112}

Step 2: Since Leo wants each team to have the same number of forwards and guards, we can assume that the number of forwards and guards on each team will be the same. Let's denote this number as x.

Step 3: We know that the total number of players must be divisible by the number of teams, and since each team has the same number of forwards and guards, the total number of forwards and guards must also be divisible by the number of teams.

Step 4: Let's find the maximum number of teams that can be created with the given conditions. To do this, we'll find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the total number of forwards and guards.
GCD(Forwards, Guards) = GCD(32, 80)

Step 5: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:

- Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.
- Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.
- Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the remainder is 0.

Step 6: Let's apply the Euclidean algorithm:

- 80 / 32 = 2 remainder 0
- 32 / 0 = undefined (we have found the GCD)

Since the remainder is 0, the GCD of 32 and 80 is 32. This means that the total number of players (112) is divisible by 32, and the number of teams can be 32.

Step 7: Now, let's find the number of forwards and guards on each team. Since there are 32 teams and the GCD of forwards and guards is 32, each team will have 32 forwards and 32 guards.

Step 8: However, we were asked to find the number of guards on each team, so let's find that value:

- Number of guards on each team = Total guards / Number of teams
- Number of guards on each team = 80 / 32
- Number of guards on each team = \boxed{2.5}

Since we cannot have half a player, it means that the number of teams created is not the maximum possible number of teams. In this case, the number of teams created is less than 32, and the number of guards on each team will be less than 32.

To find the actual number of guards on each team, we need to find the smallest number of guards that can be divided evenly by the number of teams. Let's try a smaller number of teams:

- If we have 16 teams, the number of guards on each team would be 80 / 16 = \boxed{5}.

So, the final answer is: \boxed{5 guards on each team} (with 16 teams).",The answer is 5,"There are 32 forwards and 80 guards in Leo's basketball league. Leo must include all players on a team and wants each team to have the same number of forwards and the same number of guards.

Step 1: First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of tomato plants and the number of rhubarb plants.

Step 2: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let's denote the number of tomato plants as t and the number of rhubarb plants as r.

   t = 63
   r = 81

   We find the GCD using the following steps:

   r = t mod r (remainder of t divided by r)
   t = r
   r = t mod r
   ...

   We continue this process until r is 0.

Step 3: Let's perform the calculations:

   r = 63 mod 81 = 18
   t = 81
   r = 81 mod 18 = 3
   t = 18
   r = 18 mod 3 = 0

   The GCD of 63 and 81 is 3.

Step 4: Now, we can find the greatest number of rows by dividing the maximum number of plants by the GCD.

   Maximum number of rows for tomato plants = 63 / 3 = \boxed{21}
   Maximum number of rows for rhubarb plants = 81 / 3 = \boxed{27}

So, Li Na can plant up to 21 rows of tomato plants and 27 rows of rhubarb plants.",The answer is 9,Li Na is going to plant 63 tomato plants and 81 rhubarb plants.

Step 1: First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of boys and the number of girls.

Step 2: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let's start with the larger number, which is the number of girls (90). We'll divide it by the number of boys (72) and find the remainder:

90 ÷ 72 = 1 with a remainder of 24

Now, we'll take the number that was the divisor (72) and divide it by the remainder (24):

72 ÷ 24 = 3 with a remainder of 0

Since there is no remainder, we have found the GCD, which is 24.

Step 3: Now that we have the GCD, we can determine the greatest number of students that can be in each row. This number will be the GCD itself, which is \boxed{24}.

So, the greatest number of students that can be in each row is \boxed{24}.",The answer is 18,"There are 72 boys and 90 girls on the math team. For the next math competition, Mr. Johnson would like to arrange all of the students in equal rows with only girls or only boys in each row. What is the greatest number of students that can be in each row?"
7,7,"

Step 1: To find the number of boys in each team, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls and the number of boys.

Step 2: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. Let's denote the number of girls as g and the number of boys as b.

   g = 25
   b = 35

Step 3: We perform the Euclidean algorithm:

   b = g mod b (mod is the modulus operator)
   g = b quotient (quotient is the integer division)

   b = 25 mod 35 = 5
   g = 35 mod 25 = 0

Since g is now 0, we have found the GCD, which is b = 5.

Step 4: To find the number of teams, we divide the total number of each gender by the GCD:

   Number of teams = Total number of girls / GCD = 25 / 5 = 5
   Number of teams = Total number of boys / GCD = 35 / 5 = 7

However, since we want the same number of teams for both genders, we take the smaller number of teams, which is 5.

Step 5: Now, we can find the number of boys in each team:

   Number of boys per team = Total number of boys / Number of teams = 35 / 5 = \boxed{7}

So, there will be \boxed{7} boys in each team.",The answer is 7,"Rafaela is a physical education teacher and has 25 girls and 35 boys in her class.

Step 1: Let x be the number of 2-liter yellow paint containers and y be the number of 19-liter blue paint containers.

Step 2: Since the same quantity of both colors was sold, we can write the equation:

2x + 19y = Total quantity of paint sold

Step 3: We are looking for the smallest possible values for x and y that satisfy the equation. To find the smallest possible value for x, we can set y equal to 0 since the smallest possible value for y is 0 (since we cannot have a negative number of containers).

2x + 19(0) = Total quantity of paint sold
2x = Total quantity of paint sold
x = Total quantity of paint sold / 2

Step 4: To find the smallest possible value for the total quantity of paint sold, we can consider the smallest possible container size, which is 2 liters for the yellow paint. So, the smallest possible total quantity of paint sold is 2 liters.

Step 5: Plug the smallest possible total quantity of paint sold into the equation from step 3:

2x = 2
x = 1

So, the store must have sold at least 1 container of yellow paint.

Step 6: Since the same quantity of both colors was sold, we can now find the smallest possible value for y:

2(1) + 19y = Total quantity of paint sold
19y = Total quantity of paint sold - 2
19y = 2 - 2
19y = 0

So, the store must have sold at least 0 containers of blue paint.

Step 7: To summarize, the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold is:

Step 3: To find the smallest possible values for J and L, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6 and 17. The GCD of 6 and 17 is 3.

Step 4: Now, we can write the equation as:

J = L * (GCD of 6 and 17)

Step 5: Since we want the smallest possible values, we'll make L as small as possible, which is 1.

Step 6: Substitute L = 1 into the equation:

J = 1 * 3

Step 7: Therefore, the smallest number of books each could have shelved is:

\boxed{answer: Jason shelves 3 books, and Lexi shelves 17 books.}",The answer is 102,"Jason and Lexi are shelving books at a public library. Jason shelves 6 books at a time, whereas Lexi shelves 17 at a time. If they end up shelving the same number of books, what is the smallest number of books each could have shelved?"

Step 1: First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of boys and girls.

Step 2: Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can find the GCD of 10 and 15:

- 15 = 10 * 1 + 5
- 10 = 5 * 2 + 0

Since there is no remainder, the GCD of 10 and 15 is 5.

Step 3: Now, we can form groups with 5 students each (2 boys and 3 girls).

Step 4: To find the greatest number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group.

- Total students = 10 boys + 15 girls = 25 students
- Number of students in each group = 5

Step 5: Divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group:

- Number of groups = Total students / Students per group = 25 / 5 = \boxed{5}

So, the greatest number of groups that can be formed is 5.",The answer is 5,"An English teacher would like to divide 10 boys and 15 girls into groups, each with the same combination of boys and girls and nobody left out. What is the greatest number of groups that can be formed?"
answer: Ezra can buy 2 packs of nuts.,104,"

Step 1: To find the smallest number of nuts that Ezra can buy, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of nuts per pack (13) and the number of bolts per pack (8).

Step 2: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let's denote the number of nuts as n and the number of bolts as b.

Step 3: We start by writing the equation n = qb + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder. In our case, n = 13 and b = 8.

Step 4: Solving for the equation 13 = 1.625 * 8 + 0.625, we get the remainder as 0.625.

Step 5: Now, we swap the roles of n and b, and repeat the process with the new values. So, we have 8 = 13/2 - 1.5 * 0.625, which gives us a remainder of 0.

Step 6: Since the remainder is now 0, we have found the GCD, which is the largest number that can divide both 13 and 8 without leaving a remainder. In this case, the GCD is 1.

Step 7: To find the smallest number of nuts that Ezra can buy, we look for a multiple of the GCD that is greater than or equal to 13. The smallest such multiple is 13 itself.

Step 8: However, since Ezra wants to buy the same number of nuts and bolts, we need to find a multiple of the GCD that is a multiple of both 13 and 8. The smallest such multiple is 26 (since 26 = 2 * 13 = 3 * 8).

Step 9: Therefore, the smallest number of nuts that Ezra can buy is 26, and he can buy 2 packs of nuts (since 26 / 13 = 2).

\boxed{answer: Ezra can buy 2 packs of nuts.}",The answer is 104,"Ezra is buying nuts and bolts at a local hardware store. The store sells nuts in packs of 13 and bolts in packs of 8. If Ezra wishes to buy the same number of nuts and bolts, what is the smallest number of nuts that he can buy?"

Step 1: We have 48 computers and 32 printers to donate.

Step 2: To find the greatest number of schools that can be donated to, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 48 and 32.

Step 3: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:

   a) Divide the larger number by the smaller number: 48 ÷ 32 = 1 with a remainder of 8.

   b) Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder: 32 ÷ 8 = 4 with a remainder of 0.

   c) Since there is no remainder, the GCD is 8.

Step 4: The greatest number of schools that The Khan Corporation can donate to is \boxed{answer: 8}.",The answer is 16,"The Khan Corporation would like to donate 48 computers and 32 printers to local schools. The corporation would like to make sure that each school receives the same set of computers and printers, with none left over. What is the greatest number of schools that The Khan Corporation can donate to?"
There is no solution for the minimum number of hours each worker must be assigned.,22,"

Step 1: Let x be the number of hours each worker is assigned.

Step 2: The first worker is assigned in blocks of 2 hours, so the number of blocks assigned to the first worker is x/2.

Step 3: The second worker is assigned in blocks of 11 hours, so the number of blocks assigned to the second worker is x/11.

Step 4: Since both workers must receive the same number of hours, we can set up an equation: x/2 = x/11.

Step 5: To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 11(x/2) = 2(x/11).

Step 6: Simplify the equation: 11x = 22x/11.

Step 7: Multiply both sides by 11 to eliminate the fraction: 111x = 22x.

Step 8: Subtract 22x from both sides: 89x = 0.

Step 9: Since x cannot be zero (as it represents the number of hours), we can divide both sides by 89 to find the value of x: x = 89/89.

Step 10: However, since x must be a whole number (as it represents the number of hours), we know that the equation has no solution.

Final answer: \boxed{There is no solution for the minimum number of hours each worker must be assigned.}",The answer is 22,"Mitch owns a business and assigns two of his employees their shifts. He assigns the first employee shifts in blocks of 2 hours, and he assigns the second worker shifts in blocks of 11 hours.

Step 1: To find the greatest number of groups, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of sopranos and altos.

Step 2: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. Start by finding the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number:

15 (altos) ÷ 10 (sopranos) = 1 remainder 5

Step 3: Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder:

10 (sopranos) ÷ 5 (remainder) = 2 remainder 0

Step 1: Martha wants to buy the same number of pencils as pens. Let's denote the number of pens as x.

Step 2: The number of pencils Martha is buying is 18, so we have:

Pencils = 18

Step 3: Since Martha wants the same number of pencils as pens, we can write the equation:

Pencils = Pens
18 = x

Step 4: Now we need to find the smallest integer value for x that satisfies the equation.

Step 5: Solving the equation, we find that x = 18. However, since we are looking for the smallest number, 18 is not the smallest possible value for x.

Step 6: To find the smallest possible value for x, we look for the largest multiple of 2 (since x must be even to have the same number of pencils and pens) that is less than or equal to 18.

Step 7: The largest multiple of 2 that is less than or equal to 18 is 16.

Step 8: So, the smallest number of pens that Martha can buy is \boxed{16}.

The first person should take 5 steps and the second person should take 4 steps.,450,"

Solution:

1. Let's call the number of steps taken by the first person as x and the number of steps taken by the second person as y.

2. Since they are walking together, the total distance covered should be the same for both:

   Distance covered by the first person = Distance covered by the second person

   => 75x = 90y

3. To find the minimum number of steps for both, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 75 and 90.

4. Factors of 75: 1, 3, 5, 15, 25
Factors of 90: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 15, 90

5. The LCM of 75 and 90 is 375 (which is the product of the greatest common factor of 75 and 90, which is 15, and the smallest prime number greater than 15, which is 15).

6. Now, let's find the number of steps each person should take:

   Steps for the first person = Distance / Step size of the first person
   => x = 375 / 75
   => x = 5

   Steps for the second person = Distance / Step size of the second person
   => y = 375 / 90
   => y = 4

7. So, the first person should take 5 steps and the second person should take 4 steps to cover the same distance in complete steps.

answer: They will meet again at the starting point in 1 hour 16.5 minutes.,2772,"

Step 1: Calculate the distance around the stadium for one round for each runner.
P's distance = Speed * Time
P's speed = 1 mile/hour (since the problem doesn't specify a unit, we'll assume miles)
P's time = 252 seconds = 4.2 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)
P's distance = 4.2 miles

Q's distance = Speed * Time
Q's speed = 1 mile/hour
Q's time = 198 seconds = 3.3 minutes
Q's distance = 3.3 miles

Step 2: Find the difference between the distances they run in one round.
Distance difference = P's distance - Q's distance
Distance difference = 4.2 miles - 3.3 miles = 0.9 miles

Step 3: Since they are running in the same direction, the distance difference will accumulate as they run. To find out when they meet again, we need to find out how many times they run the distance difference before they meet at the starting point again.

Let x be the number of times they run the distance difference before meeting again.
Total distance they run = (P's distance + Q's distance) * x
Total distance they run = (4.2 + 3.3) * x = 7.5 * x

Since they run a total of 7.5 miles before meeting again, we can find x by dividing the sum of their distances by the distance difference.
x = Total distance they run / Distance difference
x = 7.5 miles / 0.9 miles = 8.333333333333334

Since they can't run a fraction of a round, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 9.

Step 4: Now that we know they run 9 times the distance difference, we can find the time it takes for them to run this combined distance.
Total time = (Number of rounds * Time per round) * 9
Total time = (P's distance / P's speed + Q's distance / Q's speed) * 9
Total time = ((4.2 miles / 1 mile/hour) + (3.3 miles / 1 mile/hour)) * 9 * 60 seconds/minute
Total time = (7.5 miles / 1 mile/hour) * 9 * 60 seconds/minute = 4590 seconds

Step 5: Convert the total time from seconds to minutes and hours.
Total time = 4590 seconds = 76.5 minutes (converting seconds to minutes)
Total time = 76.5 minutes = 1 hour 16.5 minutes

\boxed{answer: They will meet again at the starting point in 1 hour 16.5 minutes.}",The answer is 2772,"P and Q start at the same time in the same direction to run around a stadium.

Step 1: Since there are less than 6 dozen eggs, there are less than 72 eggs.

Step 2: Let's consider the possibilities for the number of eggs when counted in groups of 2, 3, 4, or 5.

   - If counted in groups of 2, the maximum number of eggs is 36 (since 36 pairs is 72). But this leaves an egg over, which is not possible according to the problem statement.

   - If counted in groups of 3, the maximum number of eggs is 24 (since 24 groups of 3 is 72). But this leaves 2 eggs over, which is also not possible according to the problem statement.

   - If counted in groups of 4, the maximum number of eggs is 18 (since 18 groups of 4 is 72). But this leaves 3 eggs over, which is not possible according to the problem statement.

   - If counted in groups of 5, the maximum number of eggs is 14 (since 14 groups of 5 is 70). But this leaves 2 eggs over, which is not possible according to the problem statement.

Step 3: Since none of the possibilities work, there must be a mistake in the problem statement. However, if we assume that the problem statement is correct, then it is impossible to have less than 6 dozen eggs in a basket and have none left over when counting in groups of 2, 3, 4, or 5.

The smallest number of sparrows that Bill could have observed is 13.,182,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of sparrows as S and the number of parrots as P. We know that S and P are equal.

Step 2: We also know that the sparrows are in flocks of 13 and the parrots are in flocks of 14. Since the total number of sparrows and parrots is the same, we can write an equation:

S * number of sparrow flocks = P * number of parrot flocks

Step 3: Let's denote the number of sparrow flocks as Fs and the number of parrot flocks as Fp. We want to find the smallest number of sparrows, so we should try to minimize the number of sparrow flocks (Fs).

Step 4: To minimize Fs, we should maximize Fp. Since the parrots are in flocks of 14, the smallest possible number of parrot flocks is 1 (14 divided by 14).

Step 5: Now we have:

S * Fs = P * Fp
S * Fs = 1 * 14

Step 6: To minimize S, we need to maximize Fs. Since the sparrows are in flocks of 13, the smallest possible number of sparrow flocks is 1 (13 divided by 13).

Step 7: Now we have:

S * Fs = 1 * 14
1 * Fs = 14
Fs = 14

Step 8: Since Fs is the number of sparrow flocks, the smallest number of sparrows that Bill could have observed is the number of sparrows in one flock, which is 13 (since each flock has 13 sparrows).

Final answer: \boxed{The smallest number of sparrows that Bill could have observed is 13.}",The answer is 182,"Bill observed two types of birds in the bushes: sparrows and parrots.

4. Since 6 p.m. is 7",The answer is 6:01:00,"A bell rings every 12 seconds. A second bell rings every 15 seconds. If both the bells ring at the same time at 6 p.m., at what time will they both ring together at the same time?"
The smallest number of ducks that Morris could have observed is 13.,221,"

Step 1: Let's denote the number of ducks as D and the number of cranes as C. We know that D + C is a constant, and we want to find the smallest possible value for D.

Step 2: Since the number of ducks and cranes is equal, we can write the equation as D = C.

Step 3: To find the smallest possible value for D, we need to find the smallest possible value for C. Since cranes travel in flocks of 17, the smallest possible value for C is 1 (one crane).

Step 4: Substituting C = 1 into the equation D = C, we get D = 1.

Step 5: However, since ducks travel in flocks of 13, it's not possible for there to be only 1 duck. The smallest possible number of ducks that Morris could have observed is 13 (one flock of ducks).

Final answer: \boxed{The smallest number of ducks that Morris could have observed is 13.}",The answer is 221,"Morris observed two types of birds traveling: ducks and cranes. While the ducks traveled in flocks of 13, the cranes traveled in flocks of 17.

168,200,"

Step 1: To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 40, we can list the multiples of each number and find the smallest number that appears in both lists.

Multiples of 100: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000
Multiples of 40: 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, 280, 320, 360, 400

The smallest number that appears in both lists is 200.

Step 2: Now, we need to find how many callers must call before the 200th caller. To do this, we can find the number of callers between the first caller and the 200th caller.

Number of callers = (200 - 1) - (100 - 1) + (40 - 1)
Number of callers = 199 - 99 + 39
Number of callers = 129 + 39
Number of callers = \boxed{168}

So, 168 callers must call before someone wins both a $100 bill and a Jingle Ball ticket.",The answer is 200,Radio station Z-100 was giving away a $100 bill to every 100th caller during a contest and gave Jingle Ball tickets to every 40th caller.

24 inches,40,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many pieces of track Melanie needs to use to make a track the same length as Martin's track.

Step 2: Since Martin's track pieces are 20 inches long, and Melanie's track pieces are 8 inches long, we need to find out how many 8-inch pieces are equal to 20 inches.

Step 3: To do this, we divide the length of Martin's track by the length of Melanie's track pieces:

Number of Melanie's track pieces = Length of Martin's track / Length of Melanie's track piece
= 20 inches / 8 inches
= 2.5

Step 4: Since Melanie can't have a fraction of a track piece, she needs to use at least 3 pieces (2 full pieces and 1 partial piece) to match Martin's track length.

Step 5: Now, let's find out how long the shortest track will be when Melanie uses 3 pieces.

Length of Melanie's shortest track = Number of Melanie's track pieces * Length of Melanie's track piece
= 3 * 8 inches
= \boxed{24 inches}

So, the shortest track that Melanie can build to match Martin's track length will be 24 inches long.",The answer is 40,Melanie has pieces of train track that are 8 inches long that she is connecting together to form a track that her train can travel on. Martin is also trying to construct a track for his train but is using track pieces that are 20 inches long. How long will the shortest track be if the track that Melanie builds ends up being the same length as Martin's track?
answer: Maximum common customers = 40,20,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how many people received a free drink.
   Customers for free drink = Total customers / 75
   Customers for free drink = 3000 / 75
   Customers for free drink = \boxed{40}

Step 2: Next, let's find out how many people received a free bag of popcorn.
   Customers for free popcorn = Total customers / 30
   Customers for free popcorn = 3000 / 30
   Customers for free popcorn = \boxed{100}

Step 3: Now, let's find out how many people received both free items.
   To do this, we need to find the number of customers that are common in both sets of customers who received a free drink and a free popcorn.
   Since we don't have the exact order of customers, we can't directly find the common customers. However, we can find the maximum number of people who could have received both free items.
   This maximum number of people would be the minimum of the two numbers we found earlier (Customers for free drink and Customers for free popcorn).
   Maximum common customers = Minimum of Customers for free drink and Customers for free popcorn
   Maximum common customers = \boxed{40}

Step 4: Since we can't determine the exact number of people who received both free items without knowing the order of customers, our final answer is the maximum number of people who could have received both free items.

\boxed{answer: Maximum common customers = 40}",The answer is 20,"At the movie theatre, they give out a free drink to every 75th customer and a free bag of popcorn to every 30th customer. On Monday 3,000 customers came to the theatre. How many people received both free items?"
680 minutes,84,"

Step 1: First, let's find out how far they travel in one minute.

- Henry travels 7/60 of the track in one minute (since it takes him 7 minutes to complete the whole track).
- Margo travels 1/12 of the track in one minute (since it takes her 12 minutes to complete the whole track).

Step 2: Now, let's find the ratio of their speeds.

- Henry's speed is 7/60 of the track per minute.
- Margo's speed is 1/12 of the track per minute.
- To find the ratio of their speeds, we can compare the distances they travel in one minute: (7/60) / (1/12) = 7/60 * 12/1 = 42/60 = 7/5.

Step 3: Since they are traveling on a circular track, we can assume that their speeds are constant and that they will meet at some point. To find when they meet, we need to find a common multiple of their time intervals (since they travel at different speeds).

- Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 6.
- The LCM of 5 and 6 is 30 (since 30 is the smallest multiple that is divisible by both 5 and 6).

Step 4: Now, let's find out how long it takes for them to meet by multiplying their time intervals by the LCM.

- Henry will travel 30 * (7/60) = 21/10 of the track.
- Margo will travel 30 * (1/12) = 5/2 of the track.

Step 5: Since they are traveling on a circular track, we can add their distances to find the total distance they have traveled when they meet.

- 21/10 + 5/2 = (21 * 2 + 5 * 10) / (10 * 2) = 46/10.

Step 6: To find the time it takes for them to meet, we can divide the total distance they have traveled by the sum of their speeds.

- Time = Total distance / (Henry's speed + Margo's speed) = (46/10) / (7/5) = (46 * 5) / (10 * 7) = 460/70.

Step 7: To convert the time to minutes, we can multiply by 60.

- Time = 460/70 * 60 = 680/10.

Step 8: Since we cannot have a fraction of a minute, we can convert the time to decimal minutes by multiplying by 10.

- Time = 680/10 * 10 = 6800/10 = 680 minutes.

Final answer: \boxed{680 minutes}",The answer is 84,"Henry and Margo both began traveling around a circular track. Henry is riding his bike, and Margo is walking. It takes Henry 7 minutes to make it all the way around, and Margo takes 12 minutes. How much time will pass until they meet at the starting line?"
81,45,"

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the blinking periods of the two signs.
The LCM of 9 and 15 can be found using the prime factorization method:
9 = 3^2
15 = 3 * 5

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of the primes that appear in the factorizations of both numbers:
LCM = 3^2 * 5 = 45

Step 2: Calculate the time difference between their blinking periods.
Time difference = LCM - smaller period
Time difference = 45 - 9 = 36 seconds

Step 3: Determine the number of complete cycles of the smaller period that fit into the LCM.
Number of cycles = LCM / smaller period
Number of cycles = 45 / 9 = 5 cycles

Step 4: Multiply the number of cycles by the smaller period to find the total number of seconds in one complete cycle of the smaller period.
Total seconds in one cycle = Number of cycles * smaller period
Total seconds in one cycle = 5 * 9 = 45 seconds

Step 5: Add the time difference to the total number of seconds in one cycle to find the time until they blink together again.
Time until they blink together again = Total seconds in one cycle + time difference
Time until they blink together again = 45 + 36 = \boxed{81} seconds.",The answer is 45,Two neon signs are turned on at the same time. both signs blink as they are turned on. One sign blinks every 9 seconds. The other sign blinks every 15 seconds. In how many seconds will they blink together again?
answer,24,"

Solution:

1. First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8. The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 6 and 8.

2. To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of 6 and the multiples of 8 and find the smallest number that appears in both lists:

   Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, ...
   Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, ...

   The smallest number that appears in both lists is 24.

3. Now that we know the LCM of 6 and 8 is 24, we can determine how many days it will be before tacos and cheeseburgers are both on the menu again. Since today is one of those days, we simply count the number of days until the next occurrence of the LCM (24).

4. To find the next occurrence of 24, we can add 24 to the current day and then divide by the LCM (24) to find the number of full cycles since today:

   Days until next occurrence of 24 = Current day + 24
   Number of full cycles = (Days until next occurrence of 24) / LCM
   Number of full cycles = (Current day + 24) / 24

5. Finally, we can find the number of days until both tacos and cheeseburgers are on the menu again by multiplying the number of full cycles by the LCM (24) and then adding the remaining days from the current day:

   Days until both tacos and cheeseburgers are on the menu again = (Current day + 24) % 24 * 24 + (Current day + 24) / 24 * 24

\boxed{answer} = (Current day + 24) % 24 * 24 + (Current day + 24) / 24 * 24",The answer is 24,"The school cafeteria serves tacos every sixth day and cheeseburgers every eighth day.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 25.
The LCM of 15 and 25 is 75.

Step 2: Determine how long it takes for both clocks to chime together.
Since both clocks chime when their minutes hand points to the same number, we need to find the first time that 15 and 25 share a common multiple.

Step 3: Start counting from the least common multiple (75) and find the next common multiples of both numbers.
75 is already a common multiple, so we don't need to find any more.

Step 4: The answer is the time in minutes when both clocks chime together.
\boxed{answer = 75 minutes}",The answer is 75,Two clocks are turned on at the same time. One clock chimes every 15 minutes. The other clock chimes every 25 minutes. In how many minutes will they chime together?

Step 1: Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of the days Jenny goes to each activity.
LCM(6, 12, 18) = 36

Step 2: Since Jenny went to both classes and the library on December 1st, we need to find how many times she will go to all three activities in 36 days.

Step 3: To do this, we divide the total number of days (36) by the LCM (36) because she goes to all three activities on the same day.

Step 4: 36 / 36 = 1

So, Jenny will do both classes and go to the library again 1 day after December 1st, which is on December 2nd.

Step 1: First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of orange-flavoured sweets and the number of grape-flavoured sweets.

Step 2: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let's denote the number of orange-flavoured sweets as a and the number of grape-flavoured sweets as b.

   a = 36
   b = 44

Step 3: We perform the Euclidean algorithm steps:

   r = a mod b
   a = b
   b = r

   r = 36 mod 44 = 8
   a = 44
   b = 8

   r = 44 mod 8 = 4
   a = 8
   b = 4

   r = 8 mod 4 = 0
   a = 4
   b = 0

Step 4: The GCD is the last non-zero value, which is 4.

Step 5: Now, we can divide the number of sweets by the GCD to find the largest possible number of sweets in each tray.

   For orange-flavoured sweets:
   Largest tray size = a / GCD = 36 / 4 = \boxed{9}

   For grape-flavoured sweets:
   Largest tray size = b / GCD = 44 / 4 = \boxed{11}

72 cm,18,"

Step 1: To find the largest possible length of the side of each square colored paper, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions of the board (72 cm and 90 cm).

Step 2: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. Start by finding the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number:

90 cm ÷ 72 cm = 1 remainder 18 cm

Now, reverse the numbers and find the remainder when the smaller number is divided by the larger number:

72 cm ÷ 90 cm = 0 remainder 72 cm

Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the previous divisor, which is 72 cm.

Step 3: The largest possible length of the side of each square colored paper is the GCD, which is \boxed{72 cm}.",The answer is 18,"Martin is pasting pieces of square colored paper of equal size onto a board measuring 72 cm by 90 cm.

Step 1: First, let's find out how far each car travels in one second.

For car A:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = (1/28) * (total track length)

For car B:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = (1/24) * (total track length)

Step 2: Since they start at the same time, we can assume that the total track length is the same for both cars. Let's denote the total track length as L.

Step 3: Now, let's find out how far each car travels in one second.

For car A:
Distance = (1/28) * L

For car B:
Distance = (1/24) * L

Step 4: To find out when they will be side by side again, we need to find the number of seconds it takes for car A to travel the distance that car B travels in one second, and vice versa.

Let x be the number of seconds they are apart.

For car A:
(1/28) * L = (1/24) * L * x

For car B:
(1/24) * L = (1/28) * L * y

Step 5: Solving the equations, we get:

For car A:
x = (24/28)

For car B:
y = (28/24)

Since we are looking for the number of seconds car A is behind car B, we take the reciprocal of x:

Time = 1 / x = 28 / 24 = 7/6

So, they will be side by side again after \boxed{\frac{7}{6}} seconds.",The answer is 168,"On a track for remote-controlled racing cars, racing car A completes the track in 28 seconds, while racing car B completes it in 24 seconds. If they both start at the same time, after how many seconds will they be side by side again?"
answer,18,"

Step 1: To find the width of the strips, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two widths.

Step 2: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. Let's denote the widths as a and b, where a = 72 and b = 90.

Step 3: We start by finding the remainder when a is divided by b:

Remainder = a mod b = 72 mod 90 = 18

Step 4: Now we swap the roles of a and b, and repeat the process with the new values:

New a = b = 90
New b = Remainder = 18
Remainder = b mod a = 18 mod 72 = 18 (since 18 is already less than 72, we stop here)

Step 5: The GCD is the last non-zero remainder we found, which is 18.

Step 6: To find the width of the strips, we divide each width by the GCD:

Width of strips = Width of cloth / GCD
Width of strip from 72-inch cloth = 72 / 18 = 4
Width of strip from 90-inch cloth = 90 / 18 = 5

Step 7: Since Samantha wants to cut the strips to the same width, she should cut the strips 4 inches wide.

\boxed{answer} = 4 inches",The answer is 18,Samantha has two pieces of cloth. One piece is 72 inches wide and the other piece is 90 inches wide. She wants to cut both pieces into strips of equal width that are as wide as possible. How wide should she cut the strips?
8 inches,8,"

Step 1: To find the largest square tile, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions of the game board (16 inches and 24 inches).

Step 2: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. Let's denote 16 as a and 24 as b.

Step 3: First, we find the remainder when a is divided by b: 16 mod 24 = 16 - (24 * 0) = 16.

Step 4: Then, we swap the variables and find the remainder when b is divided by the previous remainder: 24 mod 16 = 24 - (16 * 1) = 8.

Step 5: We continue this process until we find the remainder is 0. In this case, since the remainder is already 0 for 16 mod 8, we have found the GCD.

Step 6: The GCD of 16 and 24 is 8.

Step 7: Therefore, the largest square tile Rosa can use is a tile with a side length of \boxed{8 inches}.",The answer is 8,Rosa is making a game board that is 16 inches by 24 inches. She wants to use square tiles. What is the largest tile she can use?
answer = 10,10,"

Step 1: First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 50 and 30.

Step 2: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:

- Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.
- Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.
- Repeat the process until the remainder is 0.

Step 3: Let's apply the Euclidean algorithm:

- 50 divided by 30 equals 1 remainder 10.
- 30 divided by 10 equals 3 remainder 0.

So the GCD of 50 and 30 is 10.

Step 4: The maximum number of trees per row is the GCD, which is 10.

\boxed{answer = 10}",The answer is 10,I am planting 50 apple trees and 30 peach trees. I want the same number and type of trees per row. What is the maximum number of trees I can plant per row?
7 m,7,"

Step 1: To find the greatest possible length of each plank, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three lengths.

Step 2: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. Let's start by finding the remainder when the longer piece (63 m) is divided by the middle piece (49 m):

63 mod 49 = 14

Now, find the remainder when the middle piece is divided by the shorter piece (42 m):

49 mod 42 = 7

Since the remainder is not zero, we repeat the process with the new numbers:

42 mod 7 = 2

Now, the remainder is zero, so the GCD is the last number we used, which is 7.

Step 3: The greatest possible length of each plank is \boxed{7 m}.",The answer is 7,"Three pieces of timber 42 m, 49 m and 63 m long have to be divided into planks of the same length. What is the greatest possible length of each plank?"
answer: The widest strips of fabric you can cut from either bolt without wasting any of the fabric are 15 inches wide.,15,"

Solution:

1. To find the width of the widest strips of fabric that can be cut without wasting any of the fabric, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two widths given: 45 and 60.

2. To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:
   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder: 60 / 45 = 1 with a remainder of 15.
   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder: 45 / 15 = 3 with a remainder of 0.
   - Since there is no remainder, the GCD is the last divisor we found, which is 15.

3. Now that we have the GCD, we can cut strips of fabric that are 15 inches wide from either bolt without wasting any fabric.

\boxed{answer: The widest strips of fabric you can cut from either bolt without wasting any of the fabric are 15 inches wide.}",The answer is 15,Fabric is sold in stores from bolts that are 45 or 60 inches wide.

Step 1: Find the total number of miles the two bicyclists need to cover.
Total miles = Bicyclist 1's miles + Bicyclist 2's miles
Total miles = 840 miles + 440 miles
Total miles = \boxed{1280 miles}

Step 2: Divide the total number of miles by the number of days they have to travel.
Days = Total miles / Miles per day

Step 3: Since we want to find the greatest number of miles they can bike each day, we'll assume they bike the same number of miles per day.

Step 4: To find the greatest number of miles they can bike each day, we'll divide the total miles by 2 (since there are 2 bicyclists).
Miles per day = Total miles / 2
Miles per day = 1280 miles / 2
Miles per day = \boxed{640 miles}

So, if they want to cover equal distances each day, they should bike 640 miles per day.",The answer is 40,Two bicycle enthusiasts are leaving Cincinnati at the same time.

answer = 78!,4,"

Step 1: First, let's find the total number of flowers Jessica has.
Total flowers = 8 roses + 12 daisies + 48 marigolds
Total flowers = 78 flowers

Step 2: Now, we need to find the number of ways to arrange these flowers so that no flower is left.
Since the order of arrangement doesn't matter, this is a permutation problem with repetition.

Step 3: The formula for permutations with repetition is:
P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!

Step 4: In our case, n is the total number of flowers (78) and r is the number of flowers in the garland (78 as well since all flowers are used).

Step 5: Plug the values into the formula:
P(78, 78) = 78! / (78-78)!
P(78, 78) = 78! / 0!
P(78, 78) = 78!

Step 6: Calculate the factorial of 78:
78! = 78 × 77 × 76 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

Step 7: The final answer is the factorial of 78, which is a very large number. However, for the \boxed{answer} format, we can't write such a large number directly. Instead, we can say that the number of arrangements is 78!.

Step 2: Paige has 7 pages left to do. Let's denote the number of problems on each page as x.

Step 3: Since all pages have the same number of problems, we can set up an equation:
Remaining problems = Number of pages * Problems per page
63 = 7 * x

Step 4: Solve for x:
x = 63 / 7 ≈ 9

However, since the number of problems must be a whole number, we need to round up to the nearest whole number:
x = 10

Step 5: Check if our answer makes sense:
Number of problems per page = 10
Number of remaining pages = 7
Total remaining problems = Number of remaining pages * Problems per page = 7 * 10 = 70

Since 70 is less than the remaining 63 problems, we need to round up the number of problems per page to 11:
Number of problems per page = 11
Number of remaining pages = 6
Total remaining problems = Number of remaining pages * Problems per page = 6 * 11 = 66

Since 66 is still less than the remaining 63 problems, we need to round up the number of problems per page to 12:
Number of problems per page = 12
Number of remaining pages = 5
Total remaining problems = Number of remaining pages * Problems per page = 5 * 12 = 60

Since 60 is still less than the remaining 63 problems, we need to round up the number of problems per page to 13:
Number of problems per page = 13
Number of remaining pages = 5
