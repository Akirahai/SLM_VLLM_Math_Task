2. Add the two amounts together: 215 lbs + 137 lbs = 352 lbs.

3. The problem also states that he now has 450 lbs of cement. This means that the 450 lbs is the total amount of cement he has after adding the cement he bought and his son brought.

4. To find out how much cement he had originally, subtract the total amount of cement he had before adding the 450 lbs from the total amount of cement he has now.

5. So, the calculation is: 450 lbs - 352 lbs = 98 lbs.

Therefore, he had $\boxed{98}$ lbs of cement originally.",The answer is 98,"He wanted to make sure that he is protected from the cold evenings in the forest so he decided to build a fireplace made of cement.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how much garbage the other group gathered. Since they gathered 39 pounds less than Lizzie's group, we subtract 39 from the amount Lizzie's group gathered.

Garbage gathered by the other group = Garbage gathered by Lizzie's group - 39
= 387 - 39
= 348 pounds

2. Now, to find the total amount of garbage gathered by both groups, we add the amount gathered by Lizzie's group and the amount gathered by the other group.

Total garbage gathered = Garbage gathered by Lizzie's group + Garbage gathered by the other group
= 387 + 348
= 735 pounds

So, the two groups were able to gather a total of $\boxed{735}$ pounds of garbage.",The answer is 735,"Lizzie lives in a very big and polluted city. Being an advocate for the environment, she organized a cleanup drive to help reduce the pollution. They started by cleaning the rivers that flow through and around the city.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how much land has been cleaned in total. To do this, we add the amount of land covered by Lizzie's group and the other group.

Total cleaned land = Lizzie's group + Other group
= 250 square feet + 265 square feet
= 515 square feet

2. Next, we need to find out how much land remains to be cleaned. To do this, we subtract the total cleaned land from the total land.

Remaining land = Total land - Total cleaned land
= 900 square feet - 515 square feet
= 385 square feet

So, the final answer is $\boxed{385}$ square feet of land remains to be cleaned.",The answer is 385,"After the cleaning the rivers they went on to tidy up the farmlands.

= 238 + 190
= 428

2. Next, we need to find out how many houses remain uncovered. We do this by subtracting the number of houses covered by both groups from the total number of houses in the city.

Houses remaining = Total houses - Houses covered by both groups
= 453 - 428
= 25

So, the final answer is $\boxed{25}$ houses remain uncovered.",The answer is 25,"The two groups will also collect garbage from all the 453 houses in the city. If Lizzie's group covered 238 houses while the other group covered 190, how many more houses remain?"
91,91,"

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many people are in the other group. Since Lizzie's group has 17 more members than the other group, we can represent the number of people in the other group as x.
2. We know that Lizzie's group has 54 people, so we can set up the equation: x + 17 = 54
3. To solve for x, we subtract 17 from both sides of the equation: x = 54 - 17
4. This simplifies to: x = 37
5. So, the other group has 37 people.
6. To find out how many people are working together to clean the city, we add the number of people in both groups: 54 + 37
7. This simplifies to: 91

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{91}$.",The answer is 91,"If Lizzie's group is composed of 54 people and they have 17 more members than the other group, how many people are working together to clean the city?"

Final answer: Each guest will get $\boxed{2}$ croissants, with 3 croissants remaining.",The answer is 2,"Cristina baked 17 croissants. If she planned to serve this equally to her seven guests, how many will each have?"
3,3,"

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many croissants each guest will get. To do this, we divide the total number of croissants by the number of guests.

Number of croissants per guest = Total croissants / Number of guests
= 17 / 7
≈ 2.43

Since we can't serve a fraction of a croissant, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, each guest will get 2 croissants.

2. Next, we need to find out how many croissants Cristina will have left after serving her guests. To do this, we multiply the number of croissants each guest gets by the number of guests, and then subtract that from the total number of croissants.

Croissants left = Total croissants - (Croissants per guest * Number of guests)
= 17 - (2 * 7)
= 17 - 14

≈ 10.17 servings

Since we can't have a fraction of a serving, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, each guest will get 10 servings.

2. Next, we need to find out how many servings are left unconsumed. To do this, we subtract the total number of servings each guest gets from the total number of servings.

Unconsumed servings = Total servings - (Number of guests * Servings per guest)
= 61 - (6 * 10)
= 61 - 60
= 1 serving

So, there will be 1 serving of butterscotch left unconsumed.

Solution:

1. Let's denote your age as $x$.
2. According to the problem, your mother's age is 3 times your age, so we can represent her age as $3x$.
3. The problem states that this year on your 11th birthday, your mother is 3 times as old as you. So, we can set up the equation $3x = x + 11$.
4. To solve for $x$, we first subtract $x$ from both sides of the equation, which gives us $2x = 11$.
5. Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of $x$. So, $x = 11 / 2 = 5.5$.
6. However, age is a whole number, and it's not possible to be 5.5 years old. This means there's a mistake in the problem or our understanding of it.

But let's assume that the problem meant to say that your mother is 3 times as old as you were last year. In that case, the equation would be $3(x - 1) = x + 11$.

1. To solve for $x$, we first distribute the 3 on the left side of the equation, which gives us $3x - 3 = x + 11$.
2. Then, we subtract $x$ from both sides of the equation, which gives us $2x - 3 = 11$.
3. Next, we add 3 to both sides of the equation, which gives us $2x = 14$.
4. Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of $x$. So, $x = 14 / 2 = 7$.
5. Therefore, you are 7 years old, and your mother is 3 times as old as you were last year, which is $3 * 7 = \boxed{21}$ years old.",The answer is 33,This year on your 11th birthday your mother tells you that she is exactly 3 times as old as you are. How old is she?

Since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, each classroom received 103 pencils.

2. Next, we need to find out how many pencils were left over after distributing them to the classrooms. To do this, we multiply the number of pencils per classroom by the number of classrooms and subtract that from the total number of pencils.

Pencils left over = Total pencils - (Pencils per classroom * Number of classrooms)

1. We know that one washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day.
2. We need to find out how many washing machines are needed to wash 200 pounds of clothes per day.
3. To do this, we divide the total amount of clothes to be washed by the amount of clothes one washing machine can wash per day.
4. So, the number of washing machines needed is 200 pounds / 28 pounds per machine = 7.14 machines.
5. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a machine, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
6. Therefore, we need 8 washing machines to wash 200 pounds of clothes per day.

4,4,"

Solution:

1. First, we need to determine how many times the washing machine can be fully loaded with 28 pounds of clothes per day. We do this by dividing the total amount of clothes to be washed (200 pounds) by the capacity of the washing machine (28 pounds).

2. So, 200 pounds / 28 pounds = 7.14. Since the washing machine can't be loaded with a fraction of its capacity, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 7.

3. This means the washing machine is fully loaded 7 times per day.

4. Now, we need to find out how many pounds of clothes are left after the 7 full loads. We do this by subtracting the total amount of clothes washed in the full loads from the total amount of clothes to be washed.

5. So, 200 pounds - (7 loads * 28 pounds/load) = 200 pounds - 196 pounds = 4 pounds.

6. Therefore, the washing machine that isn't fully loaded washes 4 pounds of clothes per day.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$",The answer is 4,"A washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day. If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many pounds of clothes does the washing machine that isn't fully loaded wash per day?"

15,15,"

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many full days Simon will work. To do this, we divide the total number of gift bags by the number of bags he makes per day.

Total gift bags = 519
Bags per day = 42

Full days = Total gift bags / Bags per day

Solution:

1. We know that there are 32 students in the class and the teacher divided them into 5 equal groups.
2. To find out how many students are in each group, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups.
3. So, we perform the division: 32 ÷ 5 = 6.4
4. However, we cannot have a fraction of a student in a group. Therefore, we need to round the result to the nearest whole number.
5. Since 6.4 is closer to 6 than to 7, we round down to 6.
6. Therefore, there are 6 students in each group.

Final answer: $\boxed{6}$",The answer is 6,There are 32 students in the class. The teacher divided them into 5 equal groups. How many students are there in each group?
2,2,"

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many students are in each group. To do this, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups.

Number of students in each group = Total number of students / Number of groups
= 32 / 5
= 6.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, there are 6 students in each group.

2. Next, we need to find out how many students are in all the groups combined.

Number of students in all groups = Number of students in each group * Number of groups
= 6 * 5
= 30

3. Finally, we subtract the number of students in all the groups from the total number of students to find out how many students are left.

Number of students left = Total number of students - Number of students in all groups
= 32 - 30
= 2

So, there are 2 students left.

Solution:

1. Let's denote the number of large barrels as L and the number of small barrels as S.
2. We know that the total weight of oil is 95 tons, so we can write the equation: 6L + 5S = 95.
3. We also know that we want to use the least number of barrels, so we want to minimize L + S.
4. Since we want every barrel to be fully occupied, we can't have any fraction of a barrel. This means that L and S must be integers.
5. We can start by trying different values of L and see if we can find a solution that satisfies the equation and minimizes the number of barrels.
6. If we try L = 1, we get 6 + 5S = 95, which simplifies to 5S = 89. This equation doesn't have an integer solution for S, so L = 1 doesn't work.
7. If we try L = 2, we get 12 + 5S = 95, which simplifies to 5S = 83. This equation also doesn't have an integer solution for S, so L = 2 doesn't work.
8. If we try L = 3, we get 18 + 5S = 95, which simplifies to 5S = 77. This equation also doesn't have an integer solution for S, so L = 3 doesn't work.
9. If we try L = 4, we get 24 + 5S = 95, which simplifies to 5S = 71. This equation also doesn't have an integer solution for S, so L = 4 doesn't work.
10. If we try L = 5, we get 30 + 5S = 95, which simplifies to 5S = 65. This equation has an integer solution for S, which is S = 13.
11. So, the solution that uses the least number of barrels and has every barrel fully occupied is L = 5 and S = 13.

Final answer: The transport company should use $\boxed{5}$ large barrels.",The answer is 15,"A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many large barrels should be used?"
1,1,"

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many large barrels are needed to hold 95 tons of oil. We do this by dividing the total amount of oil by the capacity of a large barrel: 95 tons / 6 tons/barrel = 15.83 barrels. Since we can't have a fraction of a barrel, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 16 large barrels.

2. Next, we calculate how much oil is left after filling the large barrels: 95 tons - (16 barrels * 6 tons/barrel) = 95 tons - 96 tons = -1 ton. Since we can't have a negative amount of oil, this means that we can't fill all the large barrels and still have 95 tons of oil.

3. Therefore, we need to use some small barrels to hold the remaining oil. We know that each small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil, so we divide the remaining oil by the capacity of a small barrel: -1 ton / 5 tons/barrel = -0.2 barrels. Since we can't have a negative number of barrels, this means that we need to use at least one small barrel to hold the remaining oil.

4. However, we also need to make sure that every barrel is fully occupied. Since we can't fill a large barrel with the remaining oil (because it would exceed the capacity of a large barrel), we need to use a small barrel.

5. Therefore, we need to use one small barrel to hold the remaining oil and one large barrel to hold the rest of the oil. This means that we need to use a total of 16 large barrels and 1 small barrel.

6. However, the question asks for the number of small barrels that should be used. Since we only need to use one small barrel, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.",The answer is 1,"A transport company bought 95 tons of oil.

Solution:

1. Let's denote the number of long pieces as L and the number of short pieces as S.
2. We know that the total length of the rope is 27 yards. So, we can write the equation: 4L + S = 27.
3. Our goal is to minimize the number of pieces, which means we want to maximize the number of long pieces.
4. Since each long piece is 4 yards, we can divide the total length of the rope by 4 to find the maximum number of long pieces that can be cut: 27 / 4 = 6.75.
5. However, we cannot have a fraction of a piece, so we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 6.
6. So, we should cut 6 long pieces, each 4 yards long.
7. To find the number of short pieces, we can substitute the value of L back into the equation: 4(6) + S = 27 => S = 27 - 24 = 3.
8. Therefore, we should cut 6 long pieces and 3 short pieces to make the least number of pieces.

Solution:

1. First, let's determine how many long pieces can be cut from the 27-yard rope. To do this, we divide the total length of the rope by the length of each long piece: 27 yards / 4 yards/piece = 6.75 pieces. Since we can't have a fraction of a piece, we round down to 6 long pieces.
2. Next, we calculate the total length of the 6 long pieces: 6 pieces * 4 yards/piece = 24 yards.
3. Now, we subtract the total length of the long pieces from the total length of the rope to find the remaining length for the short pieces: 27 yards - 24 yards = 3 yards.
4. Finally, we divide the remaining length by the length of each short piece to find the number of short pieces: 3 yards / 1 yard/piece = 3 short pieces.

Therefore, the worker should cut 3 short pieces to make the least number of pieces.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$",The answer is 3,"A worker needs to cut a 27-yard long rope into some long pieces at 4 yard each and some short pieces at 1 yard each. In order to make the least number of pieces, how many short pieces should be cut for?"

Solution:

1. We have 122 portfolios of paintings and 15 students.
2. To find out how many portfolios each student will get, we need to divide the total number of portfolios by the number of students.
3. So, we perform the division: 122 ÷ 15.
4. The result is 8 with a remainder of 2.
5. This means that each student will get 8 portfolios, and there will be 2 portfolios left over.
6. However, the question asks for the number of portfolios each student will get, not the remainder.

2,2,"

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many portfolios each student will get. To do this, we divide the total number of portfolios by the number of students.

Number of portfolios per student = Total portfolios / Number of students

≈ 8.13

Since we can't split a portfolio, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, each student will get 8 portfolios.

2. Next, we need to find out how many portfolios will be left over. To do this, we multiply the number of portfolios each student gets by the number of students, and then subtract that from the total number of portfolios.

Portfolios left over = Total portfolios - (Portfolios per student * Number of students)
= 122 - (8 * 15)
= 122 - 120
= 2

So, there will be 2 portfolios of paintings left over.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many large trucks are needed to carry the 134 tons of fruits. To do this, we divide the total weight of the fruits by the capacity of a large truck.

   Number of large trucks = Total weight / Capacity of large truck
   = 134 tons / 15 tons/truck
   = 8.93 trucks

2. Since we cannot have a fraction of a truck, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means we need 9 large trucks to carry the fruits.

3. However, the problem states that every truck should be fully occupied. If we use 9 large trucks, the last truck would only carry 134 - (8 * 15) = 14 tons, which is not fully occupied.

4. Therefore, we need to use one less large truck and use a small truck to carry the remaining fruits. So, we use 8 large trucks and a small truck.

5. The 8 large trucks would carry 8 * 15 = 120 tons, leaving 134 - 120 = 14 tons.

6. The small truck can carry 7 tons, which is less than the remaining 14 tons. So, we need another small truck to carry the remaining 14 - 7 = 7 tons.

7. Therefore, we need 8 large trucks and 2 small trucks to carry all the fruits.

Final answer: $\boxed{8}$ large trucks should be used.",The answer is 8,"Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of his fruits. A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many large trucks should be used?"

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many large trucks are needed to carry the 134 tons of fruits. We do this by dividing the total weight of the fruits by the capacity of a large truck.

   Number of large trucks = Total weight / Weight per large truck
   = 134 tons / 15 tons/truck
   = 8.93 trucks

   Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 9 large trucks.

2. Next, we calculate the remaining weight that needs to be carried by small trucks. We do this by subtracting the weight carried by large trucks from the total weight.

   Remaining weight = Total weight - Weight carried by large trucks
   = 134 tons - (9 trucks * 15 tons/truck)
   = 134 tons - 135 tons
   = -1 ton

   However, we made a mistake in our calculation. The remaining weight should be positive, not negative. The correct calculation should be:

   Remaining weight = Total weight - Weight carried by large trucks
   = 134 tons - (8 trucks * 15 tons/truck)
   = 134 tons - 120 tons
   = 14 tons

3. Now, we find out how many small trucks are needed to carry the remaining weight. We do this by dividing the remaining weight by the capacity of a small truck.

   Number of small trucks = Remaining weight / Weight per small truck
   = 14 tons / 7 tons/truck
   = 2 trucks

So, Mr. Lee should use 2 small trucks to carry the remaining 14 tons of fruits.

2. Now, let's calculate how many people are left to accommodate in small rooms. We subtract the number of people accommodated in large rooms from the total number of people: 26 - (9 * 3) = 26 - 27 = -1. Since we can't have a negative number of people, this means that all 26 people can be accommodated in large rooms, and no small rooms are needed.

Since Mr. Lee can't use a fraction of a basket, he must have used 19 baskets and left some apples unpacked.

2. To find out how many apples were left unpacked, we multiply the number of baskets used by the number of apples per basket and subtract this from the total number of apples.

Apples packed = Number of baskets * Apples per basket

3. Now, we need to find out how many lollipops are left over after distributing them equally. To do this, we multiply the number of lollipops each kid gets by the number of kids, and then subtract that from the total number of lollipops.

   Lollipops left over = Total lollipops - (Lollipops per kid * Number of kids)
   = 650 - (15 * 42)
   = 650 - 630
   = 20

4. Since there are 20 lollipops left over, and we want to distribute them equally among the kids, we need to find out how many more lollipops are needed to do so. To do this, we divide the number of lollipops left over by the number of kids, and then round up to the nearest whole number (since we can't give a fraction of a lollipop).

   Additional lollipops needed = Lollipops left over / Number of kids (rounded up)
   = 20 / 42
   = 0.4761904761904762
   = 1 (rounded up)

So, at least 1 more lollipop is needed to distribute all the lollipops equally among the kids.

1. First, we need to find out how many tarts Mrs. Dalloway needs to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts.
2. To do this, we divide the total number of tarts by the number of boxes.
   Tarts per box = Total tarts / Number of boxes
   = 85 / 10
   = 8.5
3. Since Mrs. Dalloway can't make half a tart, she needs to make 9 tarts for each box to have the same number of tarts.
4. Now, we need to find out how many tarts she needs to make in total to fill 10 boxes with 9 tarts each.
   Total tarts needed = Tarts per box * Number of boxes
   = 9 * 10
   = 90
5. Finally, we subtract the number of tarts she has already made from the total number of tarts needed to find out how many more tarts she should make.

1. First, we need to find out how many books can be shelved on each shelf if they are distributed equally. To do this, we divide the total number of books by the number of shelves.

Number of books per shelf = Total number of books / Number of shelves
= 4,305 / 83
= 51.87

Since we can't have a fraction of a book, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, each shelf can hold 51 books.

2. Next, we calculate how many books can be shelved in total with the current number of shelves.

Total books that can be shelved = Number of books per shelf * Number of shelves
= 51 * 83
= 4,233

3. Now, we subtract the total number of books that can be shelved from the total number of books the library currently has to find out how many books are left over.

Books left over = Total number of books - Total books that can be shelved
= 4,305 - 4,233
= 72

4. Finally, we subtract the number of books left over from the total number of books the library currently has to find out how many more books the library needs to purchase.

Additional books needed = Total number of books - Books left over
= 4,305 - 72
= 4,233

So, the library needs to purchase 4,233 more books to be able to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves.

1. First, we need to find out how many riddles each student should get if they are to get the same number of riddles. To do this, we divide the total number of riddles by the number of students.

Number of riddles per student = Total number of riddles / Number of students
= 389 / 18
≈ 21.61

Since we can't give a fraction of a riddle, we round this down to the nearest whole number, which is 21.

2. Now, we need to find out how many riddles are left over after giving each student 21 riddles.

Remaining riddles = Total number of riddles - (Number of riddles per student * Number of students)
= 389 - (21 * 18)
= 389 - 378
= 11

3. Since Sam wants each student to get the same number of riddles, he needs to distribute these remaining 11 riddles among the students. However, since 11 is not a multiple of 18, he can't distribute them evenly.

4. To find out how many more riddles he needs to distribute to make it even, we need to find the smallest multiple of 18 that is greater than 389.

The next multiple of 18 after 389 is 390 (since 389 + 1 = 390, and 390 is divisible by 18).

Solution:

1. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals at which the buses set out. The intervals are 20 minutes for stop B, 15 minutes for stop C, and 10 minutes for stop D.

2. To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of each interval until we find a common multiple. The multiples of 20 are 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, ... The multiples of 15 are 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, ... The multiples of 10 are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, ...

3. The smallest number that appears in all three lists is 60. Therefore, the LCM of 20, 15, and 10 is 60.

4. This means that the buses will set out together again after 60 minutes, or 1 hour.

5. If the first set of buses set out at 2:45, we can add 1 hour to this time to find the next time they will set out together.

6. Therefore, the next time the buses for stops B, C, and D will set out together is at 3:45.

Final answer: $\boxed{3:45}$",The answer is 3:45,"The buses from stop A to stop B set out every 20 minutes. The buses from stop A to stop C set out every 15 minutes. The buses from stop A to stop D set out every 10 minutes. If three buses for stop B, C and D set out together at 2:45, at what time will another three buses for the three stops set out together again?"

Solution:

1. First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of the time intervals of the three bosses. The LCM of 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 40 minutes is 120 minutes.
2. Convert 120 minutes to hours and minutes. 120 minutes is equal to 2 hours.
3. Since the three bosses appear together at 10:10, we need to add 2 hours to this time.
4. Adding 2 hours to 10:10 gives us 12:10.

Therefore, the three bosses will appear together again in the game at $\boxed{12:10}$.",The answer is 12:10,"There are three bosses in a computer game. Boss A appears every 1 hour. Boss B appears every 30 minutes. Boss C appears every 40 minutes. If the three bosses appear together at 10:10, at what time will the three bosses appear together again in the game?"

Solution:

1. First, let's find out how long it takes for each worker to assemble a bike.
   - A takes 1 h 30 min, which is 90 min.
   - B takes 2 h, which is 120 min.
   - C takes 1 h, which is 60 min.

2. Next, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of their working times to find out when they will all be done at the same time again. The LCM of 90, 120, and 60 is 360 min.

3. Now, let's convert 360 min into hours and minutes. 360 min is 6 hours.

4. Since they started at 8:10, we add 6 hours to this time. 8:10 + 6 hours = 14:10.

5. However, since they are working continuously, we need to consider the time they spent working on the second bike. A took 90 min to assemble the first bike, so they will start the second bike at 8:10 + 90 min = 10:40.

6. Adding the 6 hours to this time gives us 16:40.

7. But since they are working continuously, we need to consider the time they spent working on the third bike. B took 120 min to assemble the second bike, so they will start the third bike at 10:40 + 120 min = 13:10.

8. Adding the 6 hours to this time gives us 19:10.

9. However, since they are working continuously, we need to consider the time they spent working on the fourth bike. C took 60 min to assemble the third bike, so they will start the fourth bike at 13:10 + 60 min = 14:10.

10. Adding the 6 hours to this time gives us 20:10.

11. But since they are working continuously, we need to consider the time they spent working on the fifth bike. A took 90 min to assemble the fourth bike, so they will start the fifth bike at 14:10 + 90 min = 16:40.

12. Adding the 6 hours to this time gives us 22:40.

13. However, since they are working continuously, we need to consider the time they spent working on the sixth bike. B took 120 min to assemble the fifth bike, so they will start the sixth bike at 16:40 + 120 min = 19:10.

14. Adding the 6 hours to this time gives us 25:10.

15. But since they are working continuously, we need to consider the time they spent working on the seventh bike. C took 60 min to assemble the sixth bike, so they will start the seventh bike at 19:10 + 60 min = 20:10.

16. Adding the 6 hours to this time gives us 26:10.

17. However, since they are working continuously, we need to consider the time they spent working on the eighth bike. A took 90 min to assemble the seventh bike, so they will start the eighth bike at 20:10 + 90 min = 22:40.

18. Adding the 6 hours to this time gives us 28:40.

19. But since they are working continuously, we need to consider the time they spent working on the ninth bike. B took 120 min to assemble the eighth bike, so they will start the ninth bike at 22:40 + 120 min = 25:10.

20. Adding the 6 hours to this time gives us 31:10.

21. However, since they are working continuously, we need to consider the time they spent working on the tenth bike. C took 60 min to assemble the ninth bike, so they will start the tenth bike at 25:10 + 60 min = 26:10.

3. Now, we need to find out what time it will be 168 minutes after 14:15. To do this, we add 168 minutes to 14:15.
4. 168 minutes is equal to 2 hours and 48 minutes. So, 168 minutes after 14:15 is 17:03.

Therefore, the cleaners will start cleaning windows at the same time again at $\boxed{17:03}$.",The answer is 17:03,"Three cleaners, A, B, and C are cleaning the windows of a building.

Solution:

1. First, let's find out how many trees each worker can cut in an hour.
   - Worker X can cut 60/16 = 3.75 trees per hour.
   - Worker Y can cut 60/32 = 1.875 trees per hour.
   - Worker C can cut 60/24 = 2.5 trees per hour.

2. Now, let's find out how many trees they can cut together in an hour.
   - Together, they can cut 3.75 + 1.875 + 2.5 = 8.125 trees per hour.

3. Since they start cutting trees at 7:48, they will have cut 0.8 hours worth of trees by 8:00.
   - In 0.8 hours, they can cut 8.125 * 0.8 = 6.5 trees.

4. However, they can only cut 3 trees at 7:48. So, they will have to wait for the remaining 3.5 trees to be cut.
   - It will take them 3.5 / 8.125 = 0.43 hours to cut the remaining trees.

5. Therefore, they will start cutting trees again at 8:00 + 0.43 hours = 8:25.

Final answer: They will start cutting trees again at $\boxed{8:25}$.",The answer is 9:24,"Three workers are working to cut the trees. Worker X can cut a tree every 16 min, Worker Y every 32 min and Worker C every 24 min.

2. Next, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three times. The LCM of 40, 80, and 100 is 400 minutes. This means that every 400 minutes, the carpenters will install a door at the same time again.

3. Now, let's convert 400 minutes into hours and minutes. 400 minutes is equal to 6 hours and 40 minutes.

4. Finally, let's add this time to the starting time of 9:15. 9:15 + 6 hours and 40 minutes = 15:55.

So, the carpenters will install doors at the same time again at $\boxed{15:55}$.",The answer is 15:55,"Three carpenters are installing some doors for a building. Carpenter A installs a door every 40 min, Carpenter B installs a door every 1 h 20 min and Carpenter C installs a door every 1 h 40 min.

1. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 20, 10, and 8. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each number in the set.

2. To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of each number until we find a common multiple. However, a more efficient method is to prime factorize each number and then multiply the highest powers of all primes together.

3. The prime factorization of 20 is $2^2 \times 5$, of 10 is $2 \times 5$, and of 8 is $2^3$.

4. The highest powers of the primes in these factorizations are $2^3$ and $5$. Multiplying these together gives us $2^3 \times 5 = 40$. So, the LCM of 20, 10, and 8 is 40.

5. This means that Magellan should aim to have 40 of each item in his baskets.

6. To find out how many bags of balloons he should buy, we divide the number of balloons he wants (40) by the number of balloons in each bag (20). This gives us $40 \div 20 = 2$. So, he should buy 2 bags of balloons.

7. Similarly, to find out how many bags of party horns he should buy, we divide the number of horns he wants (40) by the number of horns in each bag (10). This gives us $40 \div 10 = 4$. So, he should buy 4 bags of party horns.

8. And to find out how many packages of candy bars he should buy, we divide the number of candy bars he wants (40) by the number of candy bars in each package (8). This gives us $40 \div 8 = 5$. So, he should buy 5 packages of candy bars.

9. Therefore, Magellan should buy 2 bags of balloons, 4 bags of party horns, and 5 packages of candy bars to have an equal number of each item in his baskets.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of oranges, peaches, and pears Mei has. The GCD is the largest number that can divide all three numbers without leaving a remainder.

2. The number of oranges is 15, the number of peaches is 9, and the number of pears is 18.

3. To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the two numbers are equal. Then, that number is the GCD. However, this method can be time-consuming for large numbers.

4. Instead, we can use prime factorization to find the GCD. The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5, the prime factors of 9 are 3 and 3, and the prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how far Issa jogged. Since he jogged two-thirds of the way home, we can represent the distance he jogged as 2/3 of the total distance.
2. We know that the remaining distance he walked was 3200 m. This means that the distance he jogged plus the distance he walked equals the total distance from school to his house.
3. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 2/3 * total distance + 3200 m = total distance
4. To solve for the total distance, we first need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3/2: (3/2) * (2/3 * total distance) + (3/2) * 3200 m = (3/2) * total distance
5. This simplifies to: total distance + 4800 m = (3/2) * total distance
6. Next, we subtract total distance from both sides to isolate the term with the total distance on one side: 4800 m = (1/2) * total distance

1. First, let's convert the total time they talked into minutes. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. So, 1 hour and 21 minutes is equal to 60 + 21 = 81 minutes.

2. Next, we need to find out what time it was 81 minutes before 1:06 a.m.

3. To do this, we can subtract 81 minutes from 1:06 a.m. But before we do that, we need to convert 1:06 a.m. into minutes past midnight.

4. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. So, 1:06 a.m. is equal to 1 * 60 + 6 = 66 minutes past midnight.

5. Now, we can subtract 81 minutes from 66 minutes. But since 66 is less than 81, we need to borrow 1 hour (which is equal to 60 minutes) from the 1 in 1:06 a.m.

6. So, we borrow 60 minutes from 1:06 a.m., which gives us 12:06 a.m. (or 0:06 a.m. in 24-hour format).

7. Now, we can subtract 81 minutes from 66 minutes. This gives us 66 - 81 = -15 minutes.

8. Since we can't have negative minutes, we need to borrow 1 hour (which is equal to 60 minutes) from the 12 in 12:06 a.m.

9. So, we borrow 60 minutes from 12:06 a.m., which gives us 11:06 a.m. (or 11:06 in 24-hour format).

10. Now, we can subtract 81 minutes from 66 minutes. This gives us 66 - 81 = -15 minutes.

11. Since we can't have negative minutes, we need to borrow 1 hour (which is equal to 60 minutes) from the 11 in 11:06 a.m.

12. So, we borrow 60 minutes from 11:06 a.m., which gives us 10:06 a.m. (or 10:06 in 24-hour format).

13. Now, we can subtract 81 minutes from 66 minutes. This gives us 66 - 81 = -15 minutes.

14. Since we can't have negative minutes, we need to borrow 1 hour (which is equal to 60 minutes) from the 10 in 10:06 a.m.

15. So, we borrow 60 minutes from 10:06 a.m., which gives us 9:06 a.m. (or 09:06 in 24-hour format).

16. Now, we can subtract 81 minutes from 66 minutes. This gives us 66 - 81 = -15 minutes.

17. Since we can't have negative minutes, we need to borrow 1 hour (which is equal to 60 minutes) from the 9 in 9:06 a.m.

18. So, we borrow 60 minutes from 9:06 a.m., which gives us 8:06 a.m. (or 08:06 in 24-hour format).

19. Now, we can subtract 81 minutes from 66 minutes. This gives us 66 - 81 = -15 minutes.

20. Since we can't have negative minutes, we need to borrow 1 hour (which is equal to 60 minutes) from the 8 in 8:06 a.m.

21. So, we borrow 60 minutes from 8:06 a.m., which gives us 7:06 a.m. (or 07:06 in 24-hour format).

22. Now, we can subtract 81 minutes from 66 minutes. This gives us 66 - 81 = -15 minutes.

23. Since Therefore, the answer is \boxed{7:06 a.m.}.",The answer is 11:45,Luz and Raya talked for one hour and 21 minutes on the phone. They ended talking at 1:06 a.m. What time did they start talking with each other?

1. The ratio of the weight of Meg's cat to the weight of Anne's cat is 5:7. This means that for every 5 kg Meg's cat weighs, Anne's cat weighs 7 kg.

2. Meg's cat weighs 20 kg. To find out how much Anne's cat weighs, we need to determine how many times the weight of Meg's cat (5 kg) fits into the actual weight of Meg's cat (20 kg).

3. We do this by dividing the actual weight of Meg's cat by the weight of Meg's cat in the ratio. So, 20 kg ÷ 5 kg = 4. This means that the actual weight of Meg's cat is 4 times the weight of Meg's cat in the ratio.

4. Since Anne's cat weighs 7 kg for every 5 kg of Meg's cat, and Meg's cat is 4 times heavier than the weight of Meg's cat in the ratio, Anne's cat is also 4 times heavier than the weight of Anne's cat in the ratio.

5. So, Anne's cat weighs 7 kg * 4 = 28 kg.

6. To find out how much more Anne's cat weighs than Meg's cat, we subtract the weight of Meg's cat from the weight of Anne's cat. So, 28 kg - 20 kg = 8 kg.

Therefore, Anne's cat weighs $\boxed{8}$ kg more than Meg's cat.",The answer is 8,The ratio of the weight of Meg's cat to the weight of Anne's cat is 5:7. Meg's cat weighs 20 kg. How much more does Anne's cat weigh?

\text{Bridget's stables,Jake's,"

Solution:

1. First, we need to find the ratio of stallions to mares at Jake's stables. This is done by dividing the number of stallions by the number of mares. So, the ratio at Jake's stables is 10/15.

2. Next, we simplify the ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 5. So, the simplified ratio at Jake's stables is 2/3.

3. Now, we do the same for Bridget's stables. The ratio of stallions to mares is 17/18.

4. We can see that 17/18 is less than 2/3 because 17 is less than 2 times 9 (which is 18) and 18 is greater than 3 times 6 (which is 18).

5. Therefore, the ratio of stallions to mares is lower at Bridget's stables.

Final answer: $\boxed{\text{Bridget's stables}}$",The answer is Jake's,At Jake's stables there are 10 stallions and 15 mares. At Bridget's stables there are 17 stallions and 18 mares. Where is there a lower ratio of stallions to mares?
\text{Ivan,Ivan,"

Solution:

1. First, we need to find the ratio of time spent watching TV to time spent reading for both Ivan and Brenna.
2. For Ivan, the ratio is 20 (hours spent watching TV) divided by 14 (hours spent reading).
3. For Brenna, the ratio is 11 (hours spent watching TV) divided by 10 (hours spent reading).
4. To compare the ratios, we can simplify them by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor.
5. For Ivan, the greatest common divisor of 20 and 14 is 2. So, the simplified ratio is 10 (20 divided by 2) divided by 7 (14 divided by 2).
6. For Brenna, the greatest common divisor of 11 and 10 is 1. So, the simplified ratio is 11 (11 divided by 1) divided by 10 (10 divided by 1).
7. Now, we can compare the simplified ratios. Ivan's ratio is 10/7 and Brenna's ratio is 11/10.
8. To compare these fractions, we can cross-multiply. If we cross-multiply, we get 10*10 = 100 and 7*11 = 77.
9. Since 100 is greater than 77, Ivan's ratio is greater than Brenna's ratio.

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{\text{Ivan}}$.",The answer is Ivan,"Last month, Ivan spent 20 hours watching TV and 14 hours reading. The same month, Brenna spent 11 hours watching TV and 10 hours reading. Who had a higher ratio of time spent watching TV to time spent reading?"

One-third of the number is (1/3)x, and one-fifth of the number is (1/5)x. According to the problem, the sum of these two parts is equal to eight-fifteenth of the number, which is (8/15)x. So, the equation is:

(1/3)x + (1/5)x = (8/15)x

Step 2: Solve the equation.
To solve the equation, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 3, 5, and 15 is 15. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

(5/15)x + (3/15)x = (8/15)x

Now, we can combine the fractions on the left side of the equation:

(5/15 + 3/15)x = (8/15)x
(8/15)x = (8/15)x

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the equation is true for any value of x. However, the problem asks for a specific number, so we need to find a value of x that satisfies the original equation.

Step 3: Find a value of x that satisfies the original equation.
We can choose any value for x and check if it satisfies the original equation. Let's choose x = 15 (since 15 is the denominator of the fractions in the original equation):

(1/3)(15) + (1/5)(15) = (8/15)(15)
5 + 3 = 8
8 = 8

So, x = 15 satisfies the original equation.

Solution:

Let's denote the current age of the father as F and the current ages of the children as C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5.

From the problem, we know that:

F = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 ...... (1)

After 15 years, the father will be F + 15 years old, and each child will be 15 years older than their current age. So, the sum of the ages of the children will be:

C1 + 15 + C2 + 15 + C3 + 15 + C4 + 15 + C5 + 15 = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 + 75 ...... (2)

From the problem, we also know that after 15 years, the sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father. So, we can write:

C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 + 75 = 2 * (F + 15) ...... (3)

Now, we can substitute equation (1) into equation (3) to get:

F + 75 = 2 * (F + 15)

Solving this equation for F, we get:

F + 75 = 2F + 30
75 - 30 = 2F - F

15,21,"

Solution:

Let's denote the present age of the father as F, the present age of the older son as S1, and the present age of the younger son as S2.

From the problem, we have two equations:

1. Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of the two sons was one-third of their father's age. This can be written as:
   (S1 - 10) + (S2 - 10) = (1/3)(F - 10)

2. The sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. This can be written as:
   S1 + S2 = F - 14

We also know that one son is two years older than the other, so we have:
   S1 = S2 + 2

Now, let's solve these equations step by step:

From the third equation, we can express S1 in terms of S2:
   S1 = S2 + 2

Substitute S1 in the second equation:
   (S2 + 2) + S2 = F - 14
   This simplifies to:
   2S2 + 2 = F - 14

Now, let's substitute S1 and S2 in the first equation:
   (S2 + 2 - 10) + (S2 - 10) = (1/3)(F - 10)
   This simplifies to:
   2S2 - 18 = (1/3)(F - 10)

Now, we have two equations with two variables:
   2S2 + 2 = F - 14
   2S2 - 18 = (1/3)(F - 10)

Multiply the second equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
   6S2 - 54 = F - 10

Now, subtract the first equation from the modified second equation:
   (6S2 - 54) - (2S2 + 2) = (F - 10) - (F - 14)
   This simplifies to:
   4S2 - 56 = 4
   Divide both sides by 4:
   S2 - 14 = 1
   So, S2 = 15

Substitute S2 = 15 in the equation S1 = S2 + 2:
   S1 = 15 + 2 = 17

Substitute S1 = 17 and S2 = 15 in the equation S1 + S2 = F - 14:
   17 + 15 = F - 14
   This simplifies to:
   F = 46

So, the present age of the father is 46 years, the present age of the older son is 17 years, and the present age of the younger son is 15 years.

The final answer is:
Father's present age = $\boxed{46}$ years
Older son's present age = $\boxed{17}$ years
Younger son's present age = $\boxed{15}$ years",The answer is 21,"Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. One son is two years older than the other and sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. Find the present ages of all."

Step 1: Identify the fixed charge and the charge per km.
Let's denote the fixed charge as F and the charge per km as C.

Solution:

Let's denote the original speed of the train as $v$ km/hr and the scheduled time as $t$ hours. The distance covered by the train is then $d = vt$.

If the train were 6 km/hr faster, its speed would be $v + 6$ km/hr, and it would take $t - 8$ hours to cover the same distance. So we have the equation:

$$d = (v + 6)(t - 8)$$

If the train were 6 km/hr slower, its speed would be $v - 6$ km/hr, and it would take $t + 12$ hours to cover the same distance. So we have the equation:

$$d = (v - 6)(t + 12)$$

Now we have a system of three equations:

1. $d = vt$
2. $d = (v + 6)(t - 8)$
3. $d = (v - 6)(t + 12)$

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $v$, $t$, and $d$.

First, let's subtract the second equation from the first equation:

$$0 = vt - (v + 6)(t - 8)$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$$0 = 6t - 48$$

So $t = 8$.

Substituting $t = 8$ into the first equation, we get:

$$d = v \cdot 8$$

Substituting $t = 8$ into the second equation, we get:

$$d = (v + 6) \cdot 0$$

So $d = 0$, which is not possible. This means there must be a mistake in the problem statement or in our interpretation of it.

However, if we assume that the train would have 8 hours less if it were 6 km/hr faster, and it would have taken 12 hours more if it were 6 km/hr slower, we can solve the problem as follows:

Substituting $t = 8$ into the third equation, we get:

$$d = (v - 6) \cdot 20$$

Equating the two expressions for $d$, we get:

$$vt = (v - 6) \cdot 20$$

Substituting $t = 8$ into this equation, we get:

$$8v = 20v - 120$$

So $v = 15$ km/hr.

Substituting $v = 15$ into the first equation, we get:

$$d = 15 \cdot 8 = \boxed{120 \text{ km}}$$

So the length of the journey is 120 km. $\blacksquare$",The answer is 1440,"A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time.

Let's denote the original fraction as x/y, where x is the numerator and y is the denominator.

According to the problem, if we add 1 to both the numerator and the denominator, the fraction becomes 4/5. So we can write the equation:

(x + 1) / (y + 1) = 4/5

Similarly, if we subtract 5 from both the numerator and the denominator, the fraction becomes 1/2. So we can write another equation:

(x - 5) / (y - 5) = 1/2

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) (x + 1) / (y + 1) = 4/5
2) (x - 5) / (y - 5) = 1/2

We can solve this system of equations by cross-multiplication:

From equation 1:

5x + 5 = 4y + 4
5x - 4y = -1 ...(Equation 3)

From equation 2:
2(x - 5) = 1(y - 5)
2x - 10 = y - 5
2x - y = 5 ...(Equation 4)

Now we can solve this system of linear equations using substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply equation 4 by 4 to make the coefficients of y the same in both equations:

8x - 4y = 20 ...(Equation 5)

Now subtract equation 3 from equation 5:

(8x - 4y) - (5x - 4y) = 20 - (-1)
3x = 21
x = 21 / 3
x = 7

Substitute x = 7 into equation 4:

1. Let's denote the tuition fee as T and the room and board fee as R.
2. According to the problem, we have two equations:
   - T + R = $2,584 (total cost)
   - T = R + $704 (tuition is $704 more than room and board)

2. Now, we have the number of empty spaces (81) and the number of filled spaces (36). To find the ratio of empty spaces to filled spaces, we divide the number of empty spaces by the number of filled spaces: 81 / 36.
3. Simplifying the fraction, we get: 81 / 36 = 2.25.
4. However, ratios are typically expressed as whole numbers. So, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get rid of the decimal: 2.25 * 4 = 9.
5. Therefore, the ratio of empty spaces to filled spaces is 9:4.

Solution:

1. The ratio of empty spaces to taken spaces is 5:4. This means that for every 5 empty spaces, there are 4 taken spaces.
2. We know that there are 35 empty spaces. To find out how many sets of 5 empty spaces there are, we divide the total number of empty spaces by 5.
   Number of sets = Total empty spaces / Empty spaces per set
   = 35 / 5
   = 7
3. Since each set of 5 empty spaces corresponds to 4 taken spaces, we can find the total number of taken spaces by multiplying the number of sets by 4.
   Total taken spaces = Number of sets * Taken spaces per set
   = 7 * 4
   = 28
4. To find the total number of spaces in the parking lot, we add the total number of empty spaces and the total number of taken spaces.
   Total spaces = Total empty spaces + Total taken spaces
   = 35 + 28
   = 63

1. First, we need to find out how many brownies were sold. We know that there were 104 items sold in total and 48 of them were cookies. So, we subtract the number of cookies from the total number of items to find the number of brownies:

   Brownies sold = Total items sold - Cookies sold
   = 104 - 48
   = 56

2. Now that we know there were 56 brownies sold, we can find the ratio of brownies sold to cookies sold. A ratio is a comparison of two quantities.

104,260,"1. Let's denote the number of restaurants as R and the number of clothing stores as C.
2. We know that Tayli gave out the same number of red and blue flyers, so we can write this as an equation: 13R = 20C.
3. To find the minimum number of flyers of each color she distributed, we need to find the smallest values of R and C that satisfy this equation.
4. We can start by finding the smallest value of R that makes 13R a multiple of 20. The smallest such value is 20/13 = 1.5, but since we can't have half a restaurant, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2.
5. So, R = 2. Substituting this into the equation, we get 13*2 = 20C, which simplifies to C = 13/10 = 1.3, but again, we can't have a fraction of a clothing store, so we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2.
6. So, C = 2. Substituting this back into the equation, we get 13*2 = 20*2, which simplifies to 26 = 40. This is not correct, so we need to find the next smallest values of R and C that satisfy the equation.
7. The next smallest value of R that makes 13R a multiple of 20 is 4 (since 13*4 = 52, which is a multiple of 20). Substituting this into the equation, we get 13*4 = 20C, which simplifies to C = 13*4/20 = 2.6, but again, we can't have a fraction of a clothing store, so we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3.
8. So, C = 3. Substituting this back into the equation, we get 13*4 = 20*3, which simplifies to 52 = 60. This is still not correct, so we need to find the next smallest values of R and C that satisfy the equation.
9. The next smallest value of R that makes 13R a multiple of 20 is 5 (since 13*5 = 65, which is a multiple of 20). Substituting this into the equation, we get 13*5 = 20C, which simplifies to C = 13*5/20 = 3.25, but again, we can't have a fraction of a clothing store, so we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4.
10. So, C = 4. Substituting this back into the equation, we get 13*5 = 20*4, which simplifies to 65 = 80. This is still not correct, so we need to find the next smallest values of R and C that satisfy the equation.
11. The next smallest value of R that makes 13R a multiple of 20 is 6 (since 13*6 = 78, which is a multiple of 20). Substituting this into the equation, we get 13*6 = 20C, which simplifies to C = 13*6/20 = 3.9, but again, we can't have a fraction of a clothing store, so we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4.
12. So, C = 4. Substituting this back into the equation, we get 13*6 = 20*4, which simplifies to 78 = 80. This is still not correct, so we need to find the next smallest values of R and C that satisfy the equation.
13. The next smallest value of R that makes 13R a multiple of 20 is 8 (since 13*8 = 104, which is a multiple of 20). Substituting this into the equation, we get 13*8 = 20C, which simplifies to C = 13*8/20 = 5.2, but again, we can't have a fraction of a clothing store, so we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 6.
14. So, C = 6. Substituting this back into the equation, we get 13*8 =  Therefore, the answer is \boxed{104}.",The answer is 260,"Tayli wishes to advertise her business, so she gives packs of 13 red flyers to each restaurant owner and sets of 20 blue flyers to each clothing store owner.

Solution:

1. The choir teacher wants to divide the singers into groups with the same combination of sopranos and altos. This means that the number of sopranos and altos in each group must be factors of the total number of sopranos and altos, respectively.
2. The total number of sopranos is 10, and the total number of altos is 15.
3. To find the greatest number of groups, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of sopranos and altos. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
4. The GCD of 10 and 15 is 5.
5. Therefore, the choir teacher can divide the singers into 5 groups, with each group having 2 sopranos (10 sopranos / 5 groups) and 3 altos (15 altos / 5 groups).

Final answer: The greatest number of groups the choir teacher can make is $\boxed{5}$.",The answer is 5,"A choir teacher is dividing 10 sopranos and 15 altos into singing groups.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 72 and 108. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.

2. To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of each number until we find a common multiple. However, a more efficient method is to prime factorize each number and then multiply the highest powers of all primes together.

3. The prime factorization of 72 is $2^3 \times 3^2$.

4. The prime factorization of 108 is $2^2 \times 3^3$.

5. The highest powers of the primes in the factorizations are $2^3$ and $3^3$.

6. Therefore, the LCM of 72 and 108 is $2^3 \times 3^3 = 8 \times 27 = 216$.

7. This means that the traffic lights will change simultaneously again after 216 seconds.

8. To convert 216 seconds into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). This gives us $216 \div 60 = 3$ minutes and 36 seconds.

9. To convert 3 minutes and 36 seconds into hours, we divide the minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). This gives us $3 \div 60 = 0$ hours and 3 minutes.

10. Therefore, the traffic lights will change simultaneously again at 9 a.m. + 0 hours and 3 minutes = $\boxed{09:03}$.",The answer is 9:03:36,"The traffic lights at two road junctions change after every 72 seconds and 108 seconds respectively. If they change simultaneously at 9 a.m., at what time will they change simultaneously again?"

Solution:

1. First, we need to find the total number of pencils Martha is buying. Since she is buying 18 packs of pencils, and we don't know how many pencils are in each pack, we'll just call the number of pencils in each pack ""p"". So, the total number of pencils is 18p.

2. Next, we need to find the total number of pens Martha is buying. She is buying 14 packs of pens, and we'll call the number of pens in each pack ""q"". So, the total number of pens is 14q.

3. Martha wants to buy the same number of pencils as pens. So, we can set up the equation 18p = 14q.

4. We want to find the smallest number of pens Martha can buy. This will happen when the number of pens in each pack (q) is as large as possible.

5. To find the largest possible value of q, we can divide both sides of the equation by 14. This gives us p = (14/18)q.

6. Since p and q must be whole numbers (you can't have a fraction of a pencil or pen), the largest possible value of q is the largest factor of 18 that is less than or equal to 14. The largest such factor is 12.

7. Substituting q = 12 into the equation p = (14/18)q gives us p = 14.

8. So, Martha can buy 14 pencils in each pack and 12 pens in each pack. This means she is buying 18 * 14 = 252 pencils and 14 * 12 = 168 pens.

9. Therefore, the smallest number of pens Martha can buy is $\boxed{168}$.",The answer is 126,"Martha is buying 18 packs of pencils and 14 packs of pens from the store. If Martha wishes to purchase the same number of pencils as pens, what is the smallest number of pens that she can buy?"

2. To find out when they will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 90 and 60.
3. The prime factorization of 90 is 2 * 3^2 * 5, and the prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3 * 5.
4. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes that appear in either factorization. So, the LCM of 90 and 60 is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 = 180.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the time it takes for P and Q to complete a round. The LCM of 252 and 198 is 1260 seconds.
2. Next, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the time it takes for P and Q to complete a round. The GCD of 252 and 198 is 66 seconds.
3. Now, we can find the time it takes for P and Q to meet again at the starting point by dividing the LCM by the GCD. So, 1260 / 66 = 19.
4. Therefore, P and Q will meet again at the starting point after 19 rounds.
5. To find the time it takes for them to meet again, we multiply the number of rounds by the time it takes for P to complete a round. So, 19 * 252 = 4788 seconds.

1. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of cookies and pizza slices, which is 20 and 40, respectively. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

2. To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm involves subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the two numbers are equal. In this case, we subtract 20 from 40 to get 20. Since 20 is equal to 20, the GCD is 20.

3. Now that we have the GCD, we can determine the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices each student can get. Since the GCD is 20, each student can get 20 cookies and 20 slices of pizza.

4. To verify that this is the correct answer, we can divide the total number of cookies and pizza slices by the number of students. If there are no remainders, then the answer is correct. In this case, there are 20 cookies and 40 slices of pizza, and there are 2 students. If each student gets 20 cookies and 20 slices of pizza, then there will be no cookies or pizza slices left over.

5. Therefore, the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices the students can each get is $\boxed{20}$.",The answer is 20,The Math Counts Club had a party at school. There were 20 cookies and 40 slices of pizza to be shared equally. Each student had the same number of whole cookies and the same number of slices of pizza with nothing left over.

Solution:

1. The problem states that the sweets need to be divided into trays with an equal number of sweets in each tray, and there should be no remainder. This means that the number of sweets in each tray must be a common divisor of the total number of orange-flavoured sweets (36) and grape-flavoured sweets (44).

2. To find the largest possible number of sweets in each tray, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 36 and 44.

3. The GCD of two numbers can be found using the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the two numbers are equal.

4. In this case, we can start by subtracting the smaller number (36) from the larger number (44). This gives us 8.

5. Now, we have two new numbers: 36 and 8. We can repeat the process by subtracting the smaller number (8) from the larger number (36). This gives us 28.

6. We continue this process until we get a remainder of 0. In this case, we subtract 8 from 28 to get 20, then subtract 8 from 20 to get 12, then subtract 8 from 12 to get 4, and finally subtract 4 from 8 to get 4.

7. Since we have a remainder of 0, we have found the GCD of 36 and 44. The GCD is 4.

8. Therefore, the largest possible number of sweets in each tray is 4.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$",The answer is 4,"Tim has a bag of 36 orange-flavoured sweets and Peter has a bag of 44 grape-flavoured sweets.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the time it takes for each car to complete the track. The LCM of 28 and 24 is 168 seconds.
2. This means that after 168 seconds, both cars will have completed a whole number of laps and be back at the starting point.
3. However, we need to find out when they will be side by side again, not just at the starting point.
4. To do this, we need to find the smallest number of laps that both cars can complete in the same amount of time.
5. Car A completes 168/28 = 6 laps in 168 seconds, while car B completes 168/24 = 7 laps in 168 seconds.
6. Therefore, after 168 seconds, car A will have completed 6 laps and car B will have completed 7 laps.
7. To find when they will be side by side again, we need to find the smallest number of laps that both cars can complete in the same amount of time.
8. This will happen when car A has completed 7 laps and car B has completed 8 laps.
9. Car A completes 1 lap in 28 seconds, so it will take 7*28 = 196 seconds for car A to complete 7 laps.
10. Car B completes 1 lap in 24 seconds, so it will take 8*24 = 192 seconds for car B to complete 8 laps.
11. Therefore, after 196 seconds, both cars will be side by side again.

1. First, we need to find the total distance both cyclists will cover. This is the sum of the distances from Cincinnati to Boston and Cincinnati to Atlanta.

Total distance = Distance to Boston + Distance to Atlanta
= 840 miles + 440 miles
= 1280 miles

2. Next, we need to find the greatest number of miles each cyclist can bike per day if they want to cover equal distances each day. To do this, we divide the total distance by the number of days.

Since both cyclists are leaving at the same time and we want to find the greatest number of miles they can bike per day, we can assume they will bike for the same number of days. Let's denote this number as 'd'.

So, the greatest number of miles each cyclist can bike per day is:

Greatest number of miles per day = Total distance / Number of days
= 1280 miles / d

3. However, the problem doesn't specify the number of days 'd'. But we can infer that 'd' must be a factor of 1280 because the cyclists want to cover equal distances each day.

4. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 840 and 440 is 40. This means that the cyclists can cover equal distances each day if they bike for a number of days that is a multiple of 40.

5. Therefore, the greatest number of miles each cyclist can bike per day is:

Greatest number of miles per day = 1280 miles / 40
= 32 miles

So, the final answer is $\boxed{32}$.",The answer is 40,Two bicycle enthusiasts are leaving Cincinnati at the same time. One is biking 840 miles to Boston. The other is biking 440 miles to Atlanta.

Solution:

1. First, we need to find the total number of flowers Jessica has. She has 8 roses, 12 daisies, and 48 marigolds. So, the total number of flowers is:

Total flowers = Roses + Daisies + Marigolds
= 8 + 12 + 48
= 68

2. Next, we need to find the number of ways Jessica can arrange these flowers. This is a permutation problem because the order of the flowers matters (since it's a garland). The formula for permutations is:

Permutations = Total flowers! / (Roses! * Daisies! * Marigolds!)

3. Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Permutations = 68! / (8! * 12! * 48!)

4. Calculating this gives us the number of arrangements Jessica can make. However, this is a very large number and it's not practical to calculate it directly. Instead, we can simplify it by canceling out common factors in the numerator and the denominator.

5. After simplifying, we get:

Permutations = (68 * 67 * 66 * 65 * 64 * 63 * 62 * 61 * 60 * 59 * 58 * 57 * 56 * 55 * 54 * 53 * 52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 47 * 46 * 45 * 44 * 43 * 42 * 41 * 40 * 39 * 38 * 37 * 36 * 35 * 34 * 33 * 32 * 31 * 30 * 29 * 28 * 27 * 26 * 25 * 24 * 23 * 22 * 21 * 20 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 48 * 47 * 46 * 45 * 44 * 43 * 42 * 41 * 40 * 39 * 38 * 37 * 36 * 35 * 34 * 33 * 32 * 31 * 30 * 29 * 28 * 27 * 26 * 25 * 24 * 23 * 22 * 21 * 20 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)

Number of Starbursts per friend = Total Starbursts / Number of friends
= 45 / 18
= 2.5

2. However, since we cannot give half a Starburst to a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, each friend received 2 Starbursts.

3. Now, we need to find out how many Starbursts were left after Sean gave them to his friends. To do this, we multiply the number of Starbursts each friend received by the number of friends.

Total Starbursts given to friends = Starbursts per friend * Number of friends
