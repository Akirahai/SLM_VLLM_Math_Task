3. Calculate how many star-shaped stones Betty will have after receiving the stones from Brenda.
4. Divide the total number of star-shaped stones Betty has by the number of bracelets she wants to make.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. Brenda initially has 3 bracelets with star-shaped stones. Since each bracelet has an unknown number of star-shaped stones, we will assume each bracelet has \( x \) star-shaped stones. Therefore, Brenda has \( 3x \) star-shaped stones.
2. Brenda gives 36 star-shaped stones to Betty.
3. After receiving the 36 star-shaped stones from Brenda, Betty will have \( 3x + 36 \) star-shaped stones.
4. Betty wants to make 3 bracelets, so we need to divide the total number of star-shaped stones she has by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x + 36}{3} = x + 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of star-shaped stones in each of the bracelet Betty makes for Brenda is \(\boxed{x + 12}\). However, since the problem does not specify the number of star-shaped stones in each of Brenda's original bracelets, we cannot determine a numerical answer without additional information. If we assume each of Brenda's original bracelets has 12 star-shaped stones (which is a common assumption in such problems if not specified otherwise), then \( x = 12 \), and the number of star-shaped stones in each bracelet Betty makes would be:

522,522," To determine how many 1-inch square pieces of fudge the pan can hold, we need to calculate the area of the pan and then divide that area by the area of each square piece.

First, let's calculate the area of the pan. The pan is a rectangle with sides measuring 18 inches and 29 inches. The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[
A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]
Substituting the given dimensions:
\[
A = 18 \, \text{inches} \times 29 \, \text{inches}
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[
18 \times 29
\]

To make the multiplication easier, we can use the distributive property:
\[
18 \times 29 = 18 \times (30 - 1)
\]
\[
18 \times 29 = 18 \times 30 - 18 \times 1
\]

Now, calculate each term separately:
\[
18 \times 30 = 540
\]
\[
18 \times 1 = 18
\]

Subtract the second product from the first:
\[
540 - 18 = 522
\]

So, the area of the pan is 522 square inches.

Starting from the rightmost digit (the units place):
- Subtract 3 from 2. Since 2 is less than 3, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place. This makes the 2 in the units place 12 and the 2 in the tens place 1. Now, \(12 - 3 = 9\).

Next, move to the tens place:
- Subtract 1 from 1. Since we borrowed 1 from the hundreds place, the 2 in the tens place is now 1. Now, \(1 - 1 = 0\).

Finally, move to the hundreds place:
- Subtract 5 from 1. Since we borrowed 1 from the thousands place, the 2 in the hundreds place is now 1. Now, \(11 - 5 = 6\).

And finally, move to the thousands place:
- Subtract 0 from 1. Now, \(1 - 0 = 1\).

  ",The answer is 8,A company donates 935 pencils to a school. The pencils are divided evenly among 9 classrooms. The rest of the pencils are given to the library. How many pencils were donated to the library?
1,8," To determine how many pencils were donated to the library, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pencils per classroom:**
   The total number of pencils is 935, and they are divided evenly among 9 classrooms. We perform the division:
   \[
   935 \div 9
   \]

2. **Perform the division:**
   To divide 935 by 9, we can use long division:
   - 9 goes into 93 (the first two digits of 935) 10 times because \(9 \times 10 = 90\).
   - Subtract 90 from 93 to get a remainder of 3.
   - Bring down the next digit, which is 5, making it 35.
   - 9 goes into 35 four times because \(9 \times 4 = 36\).
   - Subtract 36 from 35 to get a remainder of -1. Since this is not possible, we adjust our calculation.

   Correct calculation:
   - 9 goes into 93 (the first two digits of 935) 10 times because \(9 \times 10 = 90\).
   - Subtract 90 from 93 to get a remainder of 3.
   - Bring down the next digit, which is 5, making it 35.
   - 9 goes into 35 four times because \(9 \times 4 = 36\).

83.20,83.2," To determine the cost of the iPod after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the discount.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of the discount.**

The original price of the iPod is $128, and the discount is 35%. To find out how much the discount is in dollars, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal).

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 128 \times 0.35 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ 128 \times 0.35 = 44.80 \]

So, the discount amount is $44.80.

**Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price.**

Since we cannot have a fraction of a washing machine, we need to round up to the next whole number. This is because even if we have a fraction of a machine needed, we still need an additional machine to wash the remaining clothes. Therefore, we round 7.14 up to 8.

So, the number of washing machines needed is \boxed{8}.",The answer is 8,"A washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day. If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many washing machines are needed?"
4,4," To determine how many pounds of clothes the washing machine that isn't fully loaded washes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days required to wash 200 pounds of clothes if the washing machine can wash 28 pounds per day.
2. Determine how many pounds of clothes are washed by the washing machine that isn't fully loaded.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to wash 200 pounds of clothes. We do this by dividing the total weight of the clothes by the capacity of the washing machine:

\[
\frac{200}{28} = 7.142857\ldots
\]

Since the washing machine can only operate in whole days, we need to round up to the next whole number. This means it will take 8 days to wash all the clothes. In 7 days, the washing machine will wash:

\[
7 \times 28 = 196 \text{ pounds}
\]

This leaves:

\[
200 - 196 = 4 \text{ pounds}

13,13," To determine how many days Simon needs to finish making 519 gift bags at a rate of 42 bags per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of gift bags Simon needs to make, which is 519.
2. Identify the rate at which Simon makes the gift bags, which is 42 bags per day.
3. Divide the total number of gift bags by the rate at which Simon makes them to find the number of days required.

The calculation is as follows:
\[
\frac{519}{42}
\]

To perform the division, we can use long division. First, we see how many times 42 goes into 51. It goes in 1 time because \(42 \times 1 = 42\). We subtract 42 from 51 to get a remainder of 9. Then, we bring down the next digit, which is 9, making it 99. We see how many times 42 goes into 99. It goes in 2 times because \(42 \times 2 = 84\). We subtract 84 from 99 to get a remainder of 15. Since 15 is less than 42, we stop here.

So, the quotient is 12 with a remainder of 15. This means that Simon can make 12 full days of gift bags, and he will have 15 gift bags left to make on the 13th day. Therefore, Simon needs 13 days to finish making all the gift bags.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]",The answer is 13,"If Simon needs to make 519 gift bags at a rate of 42 bags per day, how many days does he need to finish making all the gift boxes?"
15,15," To determine how many gift bags Simon will make on the last day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Simon will take to make 519 gift bags at a rate of 42 bags per day.
2. Determine how many gift bags Simon will have made by the end of the day before the last day.
3. Subtract the number of gift bags made by the end of the day before the last day from the total number of gift bags to find out how many gift bags he will make on the last day.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the total number of days Simon will take to make 519 gift bags at a rate of 42 bags per day.
   \[
   \text{Total days} = \left\lceil \frac{519}{42} \right\rceil
   \]
   First, we perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{519}{42} \approx 12.3571
   \]
   Since Simon cannot work a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole number:
   \[
   \left\lceil 12.3571 \right\rceil = 13
   \]
   So, Simon will take 13 days to make all 519 gift bags.

2. Determine how many gift bags Simon will have made by the end of the day before the last day.
   \[
   \text{Gift bags made in 12 days} = 42 \times 12 = 504
   \]

3. Subtract the number of gift bags made by the end of the day before the last day from the total number of gift bags to find out how many gift bags he will make on the last day.
   \[
   \text{Gift bags made on the last day} = 519 - 504 = 15

16,16," To determine how many days Jane needs to arrange all 248 vases of flowers, we start by noting that she can arrange 16 vases each day. We need to find out how many days it will take to arrange 248 vases.

First, we set up the division problem:
\[ 248 \div 16 \]

We can perform the division step by step. We start by seeing how many times 16 goes into the first two digits of 248, which are 24. Since 16 goes into 24 once (because \(16 \times 1 = 16\)), we write 1 above the division line and subtract 16 from 24:
\[ 24 - 16 = 8 \]

Next, we bring down the next digit, which is 8, making the number 88. We then see how many times 16 goes into 88. Since 16 goes into 88 five times (because \(16 \times 5 = 80\)), we write 5 above the division line and subtract 80 from 88:
\[ 88 - 80 = 8 \]

Since 16 does not go into 8, we have a remainder of 8. However, since we are dealing with whole days, we need to consider that Jane will still need to work one more day to finish the remaining 8 vases. Therefore, we add 1 more day to the 15 days we already calculated:
\[ 15 + 1 = 16 \]

So, the total number of days Jane needs to finish all the flower arrangements is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]",The answer is 16,"Jane can arrange 16 vases of flowers in a day. If there are 248 vases of flowers to be arranged, how many days are needed for her to finish all the flower arrangements?"
8,8," To determine how many vases of flowers Jane will arrange on the last day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days Jane will work:**
   Jane arranges 16 vases of flowers each day. We need to find out how many days it will take her to arrange 248 vases.
   \[
   \text{Total days} = \frac{\text{Total vases}}{\text{Vases per day}} = \frac{248}{16}
   \]

2. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{248}{16} = 15.5
   \]
   This means Jane will work for 15 full days and then have half a day left.

3. **Determine the number of vases arranged in 15 full days:**
   Since Jane works 15 full days, we calculate the total number of vases she arranges in these days.
   \[
   \text{Vases in 15 days} = 15 \times 16 = 240
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of vases left to arrange on the last day:**
   Subtract the number of vases arranged in 15 days from the total number of vases.
   \[
   \text{Vases left} = 248 - 240 = 8
   \]

Therefore, Jane will arrange \(\boxed{8}\) vases of flowers on the last day.",The answer is 8,"Jane can arrange 16 vases of flowers in a day. If there are 248 vases of flowers to be arranged, how many vases of flowers will she arrange on the last day?"
194,194," To determine how many boxes are needed to hold all 3,484 pieces of chalk, we need to divide the total number of pieces of chalk by the capacity of each box. The capacity of each box is 18 pieces of chalk.

First, we perform the division:

\[ 3484 \div 18 \]

We can do this step by step using long division.

1. **Divide**: 34 (the first two digits of 3484) by 18. 18 goes into 34 once (since \(18 \times 1 = 18\)). Write 1 above the line.
2. **Multiply**: 18 times 1 is 18. Subtract 18 from 34 to get a remainder of 16.
3. **Bring down**: Bring down the next digit, which is 8, to make it 168.
4. **Divide**: 168 by 18. 18 goes into 168 nine times (since \(18 \times 9 = 162\)). Write 9 above the line next to the 1.
5. **Multiply**: 18 times 9 is 162. Subtract 162 from 168 to get a remainder of 6.
6. **Bring down**: Bring down the next digit, which is 4, to make it 64.
7. **Divide**: 64 by 18. 18 goes into 64 three times (since \(18 \times 3 = 54\)). Write 3 above the line next to the 9.
8. **Multiply**: 18 times 3 is 54. Subtract 54 from 64 to get a remainder of 10.

So, the quotient is 193 and the remainder is 10. This means that 193 boxes can hold 193 \(\times\) 18 = 3474 pieces of chalk, and there are 10 pieces of chalk left over. Since we need to hold all 3,484 pieces of chalk, we need one more box for the remaining 10 pieces.

\[ 292 \div 16 \]

First, we perform the division:

\[ 292 \div 16 = 18.25 \]

This division tells us that 18 full paper bags can hold \( 18 \times 16 = 288 \) cookies, and there will be \( 292 - 288 = 4 \) cookies left over. Since we cannot leave any cookies out, we need an additional paper bag to hold the remaining 4 cookies. Therefore, the total number of paper bags required is:

23,23," To determine how many tanks are needed to hold all 728 gallons of oil, we need to divide the total amount of oil by the capacity of one tank. The capacity of each tank is 32 gallons.

First, we perform the division:

\[ 728 \div 32 \]

To make the division easier, we can break it down step by step. We start by seeing how many times 32 goes into 72. Since \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \), we can write:

\[ 72 - 64 = 8 \]

So, 32 goes into 72 two times, and we have a remainder of 8. Next, we bring down the next digit, which is 8, making it 88. Now, we see how many times 32 goes into 88. Since \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \), we can write:

\[ 88 - 64 = 24 \]

So, 32 goes into 88 two times, and we have a remainder of 24. Since 24 is less than 32, we cannot divide it further. Therefore, the quotient is 22 with a remainder of 24. This means that 32 goes into 728 a total of 22 times, and there are 24 gallons left over.

Since we cannot leave any oil in the remainder, we need an additional tank to hold the remaining 24 gallons. Therefore, the total number of tanks needed is:

\[ \frac{728}{32} = 22.75 \]
Since we can only fill whole tanks, we take the integer part of the division, which is 22. So, 22 full tanks can be filled.

Next, we calculate the total amount of oil used to fill these 22 full tanks:
\[ \text{Total oil used} = 22 \times 32 = 704 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of oil used from the total amount of oil bought to find out how much oil is left:
\[ \text{Oil left} = 728 - 704 = 24 \text{ gallons} \]

15,15," To determine the minimum number of barrels needed to transport 95 tons of oil with each barrel fully occupied, we should start by maximizing the use of large barrels since they hold more oil. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate the maximum number of large barrels needed:**
   Each large barrel holds 6 tons of oil. To find out how many large barrels are needed, we divide the total amount of oil by the capacity of a large barrel:
   \[
   \frac{95}{6} = 15.8333\ldots
   \]
   Since we cannot have a fraction of a barrel, we take the integer part of the division, which is 15. So, we use 15 large barrels.

2. **Calculate the amount of oil transported by the large barrels:**
   If we use 15 large barrels, the total amount of oil transported by these barrels is:
   \[
   15 \times 6 = 90 \text{ tons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining oil:**
   After using 15 large barrels, the remaining amount of oil is:
   \[
   95 - 90 = 5 \text{ tons}

6,6," To determine the least number of pieces the worker should cut from a 27-yard long rope into long pieces of 4 yards each and short pieces of 1 yard each, we need to maximize the number of long pieces because each long piece is longer and thus reduces the total number of pieces needed.

Let's denote the number of long pieces by \( x \) and the number of short pieces by \( y \). The equation representing the total length of the rope is:
\[ 4x + y = 27 \]

We want to minimize the total number of pieces, which is \( x + y \). To do this, we need to find the maximum value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 4x + y = 27 \) with \( x \) and \( y \) being non-negative integers.

First, we solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 27 - 4x \]

For \( y \) to be a non-negative integer, \( 27 - 4x \) must be greater than or equal to 0:
\[ 27 - 4x \geq 0 \]
\[ 27 \geq 4x \]
\[ x \leq \frac{27}{4} \]
\[ x \leq 6.75 \]

Since \( x \) must be an integer, the maximum value for \( x \) is 6. We substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the equation to find \( y \):
\[ y = 27 - 4 \cdot 6 \]
\[ y = 27 - 24 \]
\[ y = 3 \]

So, if the worker cuts 6 long pieces, he will have 3 short pieces. The total number of pieces is:
\[ x + y = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

To confirm that this is the minimum number of pieces, we check the next possible value for \( x \), which is 5:
\[ y = 27 - 4 \cdot 5 \]
\[ y = 27 - 20 \]
\[ y = 7 \]

If the worker cuts 5 long pieces, he will have 7 short pieces. The total number of pieces is:
\[ x + y = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Since 12 is greater than 9, cutting 6 long pieces and 3 short pieces is indeed the minimum number of pieces.

Therefore, the number of long pieces that should be cut is \(\boxed{6}\).",The answer is 6,"A worker needs to cut a 27-yard long rope into some long pieces at 4 yard each and some short pieces at 1 yard each. In order to make the least number of pieces, how many long pieces should be cut for?"
3,3," To determine the least number of pieces the worker should cut, we need to maximize the number of long pieces (4 yards each) and minimize the number of short pieces (1 yard each). Let's denote the number of long pieces by \( x \) and the number of short pieces by \( y \). The equation representing the total length of the rope is:

\[ 4x + y = 27 \]

We want to minimize the total number of pieces, which is \( x + y \). To do this, we should maximize \( x \) (the number of long pieces). Let's find the maximum possible value for \( x \) by dividing 27 by 4:

\[ 27 \div 4 = 6.75 \]

Since \( x \) must be an integer, the maximum value for \( x \) is 6. If \( x = 6 \), then we can substitute this value back into the equation to find \( y \):

\[ 4(6) + y = 27 \]
\[ 24 + y = 27 \]
\[ y = 27 - 24 \]
\[ y = 3 \]

So, if the worker cuts 6 long pieces, he will need 3 short pieces. The total number of pieces will be:

\[ x + y = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

To confirm that this is indeed the minimum number of pieces, let's consider if \( x \) were less than 6. If \( x = 5 \), then:

\[ 4(5) + y = 27 \]
\[ 20 + y = 27 \]
\[ y = 27 - 20 \]
\[ y = 7 \]

In this case, the total number of pieces would be:

\[ x + y = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

This is more than 9, so it is not a minimum. Similarly, if \( x = 4 \), then:

\[ 4(4) + y = 27 \]
\[ 16 + y = 27 \]
\[ y = 27 - 16 \]
\[ y = 11 \]

In this case, the total number of pieces would be:

\[ x + y = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

This is also more than 9. Therefore, the minimum number of pieces is achieved when \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 3 \).

The number of short pieces that should be cut is \(\boxed{3}\).",The answer is 3,"A worker needs to cut a 27-yard long rope into some long pieces at 4 yard each and some short pieces at 1 yard each. In order to make the least number of pieces, how many short pieces should be cut for?"

When we perform the division, we get:
\[ 172 \div 18 = 9.5555\ldots \]

Since we can only form whole teams, we take the integer part of the division result, which is 9. This means that we can form 9 full teams, and there will be some students left over. To find out how many students are left over, we can multiply the number of teams by the number of students per team and subtract this product from the total number of students:
\[ 172 - (9 \times 18) = 172 - 162 = 10 \]

So, after forming 9 teams, there are 10 students left over, who do not form a complete team. Therefore, the number of teams that can be formed is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]",The answer is 9,172 students are forming teams for a mountaineering competition. Each team should have 18 students. How many teams can they form?
10,10," To determine how many students will not be on a team, we need to perform the division of the total number of students by the number of students per team and find the remainder. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the total number of students and the number of students per team.
   - Total number of students: 172
   - Number of students per team: 18

2. Perform the division of 172 by 18.
   - When we divide 172 by 18, we get a quotient of 9 and a remainder. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     172 \div 18 = 9 \text{ R } \text{remainder}
     \]
   - To find the remainder, we multiply the quotient by the divisor and subtract the result from the total number of students:
     \[
     172 - (18 \times 9) = 172 - 162 = 10
     \]

3. The remainder is the number of students who will not be on a team.
   - Therefore, the number of students who will not be on a team is 10.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]",The answer is 10,172 students are forming teams for a mountaineering competition. Each team should have 18 students. How many students will not be on a team?
8,8," To determine the least number of trucks Mr. Lee should use to load 134 tons of fruits with each large truck loading 15 tons and each small truck loading 7 tons, we can follow these steps:

1. **Maximize the use of large trucks**: Since large trucks can carry more weight, we should use as many large trucks as possible. We start by calculating how many large trucks are needed if we use only large trucks:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{134}{15} \right\rfloor = 8
   \]
   Using 8 large trucks, the total weight loaded is:
   \[
   8 \times 15 = 120 \text{ tons}
   \]
   The remaining weight to be loaded is:
   \[
   134 - 120 = 14 \text{ tons}
   \]
   Since 14 tons can be loaded by 2 small trucks (because each small truck can load 7 tons), we can use 2 small trucks.

2. **Verify the total weight**: If we use 8 large trucks and 2 small trucks, the total weight loaded is:
   \[
   8 \times 15 + 2 \times 7 = 120 + 14 = 134 \text{ tons}
   \]
   This confirms that all 134 tons of fruits are loaded.

3. **Check if fewer trucks can be used**: If we use fewer than 8 large trucks, we need to check if we can still load all 134 tons with the remaining trucks. For example, if we use 7 large trucks, the total weight loaded is:
   \[
   7 \times 15 = 105 \text{ tons}
   \]
   The remaining weight to be loaded is:
   \[
   134 - 105 = 29 \text{ tons}
   \]
   Since 29 tons cannot be loaded by a whole number of small trucks (because 29 divided by 7 is not an integer), using 7 large trucks is not possible. Similarly, if we use 6 large trucks or fewer, the remaining weight will also not be divisible by 7.

Therefore, the least number of trucks needed is 10 (8 large trucks and 2 small trucks). The number of large trucks used is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]",The answer is 8,"Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of his fruits. A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many large trucks should be used?"
2,2," To determine the least number of trucks Mr. Lee should use to load 134 tons of fruits with each truck fully occupied, we need to maximize the use of large trucks since they have a greater capacity. Let's denote the number of large trucks by \( L \) and the number of small trucks by \( S \). The equation representing the total weight loaded is:

\[ 15L + 7S = 134 \]

We want to find non-negative integer solutions for \( L \) and \( S \) such that \( L + S \) is minimized. We start by finding the maximum possible value for \( L \).

First, we calculate the maximum number of large trucks that can be used:

\[ L = \left\lfloor \frac{134}{15} \right\rfloor = 8 \]

If \( L = 8 \), then the total weight loaded by the large trucks is:

\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \text{ tons} \]

The remaining weight to be loaded by the small trucks is:

\[ 134 - 120 = 14 \text{ tons} \]

Since each small truck can load 7 tons, the number of small trucks needed is:

\[ S = \frac{14}{7} = 2 \]

So, one possible solution is \( L = 8 \) and \( S = 2 \). The total number of trucks used is:

\[ L + S = 8 + 2 = 10 \]

Next, we check if using fewer large trucks would result in a smaller total number of trucks. If \( L = 7 \), then the total weight loaded by the large trucks is:

\[ 15 \times 7 = 105 \text{ tons} \]

The remaining weight to be loaded by the small trucks is:

\[ 134 - 105 = 29 \text{ tons} \]

Since each small truck can load 7 tons, the number of small trucks needed is:

\[ S = \left\lceil \frac{29}{7} \right\rceil = 5 \]

So, another possible solution is \( L = 7 \) and \( S = 5 \). The total number of trucks used is:

\[ L + S = 7 + 5 = 12 \]

This is more than the previous solution. If we use fewer large trucks, the total number of trucks will increase even more. Therefore, the solution that uses the least number of trucks is \( L = 8 \) and \( S = 2 \).

The number of small trucks that should be used is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]",The answer is 2,"Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of his fruits. A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and small truck can load 7 tons. In order to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, how many small trucks should be used?"
51,51," To determine how many 73 cm pieces of ribbon Sam made, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the length of each piece. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the total length of the ribbon: 3,730 cm.
2. Identify the length of each piece of ribbon: 73 cm.
3. Perform the division: \(3730 \div 73\).

Let's do the division step by step:

First, we check how many times 73 goes into 373. Since \(73 \times 5 = 365\), we can write down 5 and subtract 365 from 373:
\[373 - 365 = 8.\]
So, we bring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 80. Now, we check how many times 73 goes into 80. Since \(73 \times 1 = 73\), we can write down 1 and subtract 73 from 80:
\[80 - 73 = 7.\]
So, we bring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 70. Now, we check how many times 73 goes into 70. Since 73 is greater than 70, we can write down 0 and bring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 700. Now, we check how many times 73 goes into 700. Since \(73 \times 9 = 657\), we can write down 9 and subtract 657 from 700:
\[700 - 657 = 43.\]
Since 43 is less than 73, we stop here. The quotient is 51, which means Sam made 51 pieces of ribbon.

Therefore, the number of 73 cm pieces of ribbon Sam made is \(\boxed{51}\).",The answer is 51,"Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long, how many 73 cm pieces of ribbon did Sam make?"
7,7," To determine how much of the original ribbon was left after Sam cut equal-length pieces, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length of the ribbon that Sam cut.
2. Subtract the total length of the ribbon cut from the original length of the ribbon.

First, we find out how many pieces of ribbon Sam cut. Since each piece is 73 cm long and the original ribbon is 3,730 cm long, we divide 3,730 by 73:
\[
3730 \div 73 = 51
\]
So, Sam cut 51 pieces of ribbon.

Next, we calculate the total length of the ribbon that Sam cut by multiplying the number of pieces by the length of each piece:
\[
51 \times 73 = 3723
\]
So, the total length of the ribbon that Sam cut is 3,723 cm.

Finally, we subtract the total length of the ribbon cut from the original length of the ribbon to find out how much of the original ribbon was left:
\[
3730 - 3723 = 7
\]
So, the amount of the original ribbon that was left is \boxed{7} cm.",The answer is 7,"Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long, how much of the original ribbon was left?"
8,8," To determine the least number of rooms needed for the tourist group of 26 people, we need to find a combination of large rooms (which hold 3 people each) and small rooms (which hold 2 people each) such that all 26 people are accommodated and the total number of rooms is minimized.

Let's denote the number of large rooms by \( L \) and the number of small rooms by \( S \). The equation representing the total number of people is:
\[ 3L + 2S = 26 \]

We need to find non-negative integer solutions for \( L \) and \( S \) that minimize \( L + S \).

Let's start by isolating \( S \) in the equation:
\[ S = \frac{26 - 3L}{2} \]

For \( S \) to be an integer, \( 26 - 3L \) must be even. Since 26 is even, \( 3L \) must also be even. This means \( L \) must be even (because 3 is odd, and the product of an odd number and an even number is even).

We will test even values of \( L \) starting from the smallest possible value and check if \( S \) is a non-negative integer.

1. If \( L = 0 \):
   \[ S = \frac{26 - 3 \cdot 0}{2} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]
   So, \( L = 0 \) and \( S = 13 \). The total number of rooms is \( 0 + 13 = 13 \).

2. If \( L = 2 \):
   \[ S = \frac{26 - 3 \cdot 2}{2} = \frac{26 - 6}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]
   So, \( L = 2 \) and \( S = 10 \). The total number of rooms is \( 2 + 10 = 12 \).

3. If \( L = 4 \):
   \[ S = \frac{26 - 3 \cdot 4}{2} = \frac{26 - 12}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]
   So, \( L = 4 \) and \( S = 7 \). The total number of rooms is \( 4 + 7 = 11 \).

4. If \( L = 6 \):
   \[ S = \frac{26 - 3 \cdot 6}{2} = \frac{26 - 18}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]
   So, \( L = 6 \) and \( S = 4 \). The total number of rooms is \( 6 + 4 = 10 \).

5. If \( L = 8 \):
   \[ S = \frac{26 - 3 \cdot 8}{2} = \frac{26 - 24}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]
   So, \( L = 8 \) and \( S = 1 \). The total number of rooms is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

6. If \( L = 10 \):
   \[ S = \frac{26 - 3 \cdot 10}{2} = \frac{26 - 30}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \]
   So, \( L = 10 \) and \( S = -2 \), which is not a valid solution because \( S \) cannot be negative.

From the above calculations, the minimum number of rooms is 9, which occurs when \( L = 8 \) and \( S = 1 \).

Therefore, the number of large rooms that should be rented is \(\boxed{8}\).",The answer is 8,"A tourist group has 26 people.

1. Identify the total number of apples: 495.
2. Identify the number of apples per basket: 25.
3. Perform the division: \(495 \div 25\).

Let's do the division step by step:

- First, we see how many times 25 goes into 49. Since \(25 \times 1 = 25\) and \(25 \times 2 = 50\), we know that 25 goes into 49 one time. So, we write down 1 and subtract \(25 \times 1 = 25\) from 49, which gives us a remainder of \(49 - 25 = 24\).
- Next, we bring down the next digit, which is 5, making the number 245. Now, we see how many times 25 goes into 245. Since \(25 \times 9 = 225\) and \(25 \times 10 = 250\), we know that 25 goes into 245 nine times. So, we write down 9 and subtract \(25 \times 9 = 225\) from 245, which gives us a remainder of \(245 - 225 = 20\).
- Since 20 is less than 25, we stop here. The quotient is 19, which means Mr. Lee has 19 baskets of apples.

Therefore, the number of baskets of apples is \(\boxed{19}\).",The answer is 19,"Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are 25 apples in each basket, how many baskets of apples are there?"

   - The total number of apples packed is \( 25n \).

2. **Set up the equation to find the number of baskets:**
   - Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples.
   - The total number of apples packed plus the number of apples left unpacked should equal 495.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of apples left unpacked.
   - The equation is:
     \[
     25n + r = 495
     \]

3. **Determine the number of baskets \( n \):**
   - Since \( r \) must be a non-negative integer less than 25, we need to find the largest integer \( n \) such that \( 25n \leq 495 \).
   - Divide 495 by 25:
     \[
     495 \div 25 = 19.8

12,12," To determine the least number of groups the ballet class should make, we need to maximize the number of large groups (which have 7 members each) and minimize the number of small groups (which have 3 members each). Let's denote the number of large groups by \( L \) and the number of small groups by \( S \). The total number of members in the class is given by the equation:

\[ 7L + 3S = 90 \]

We want to find the maximum value of \( L \) such that \( S \) is a non-negative integer. Let's start by isolating \( S \):

\[ S = \frac{90 - 7L}{3} \]

For \( S \) to be an integer, \( 90 - 7L \) must be divisible by 3. Since 90 is divisible by 3, \( 7L \) must also be divisible by 3. The number 7 is not divisible by 3, so \( L \) must be divisible by 3. Let's list the possible values of \( L \) in descending order and check if \( S \) is a non-negative integer:

1. If \( L = 12 \):
   \[ S = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 12}{3} = \frac{90 - 84}{3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

   \( S \) is a non-negative integer.

4. If \( L = 3 \):
   \[ S = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 3}{3} = \frac{90 - 21}{3} = \frac{69}{3} = 23 \]
   \( S \) is a non-negative integer.

5. If \( L = 0 \):

\[ 7L + 3S = 90 \]

We want to find the smallest possible value for \( S \). To do this, we will start by finding the maximum possible value for \( L \). Since each large group has 7 members, we can find the maximum value of \( L \) by dividing 90 by 7:

\[ 90 \div 7 = 12.8571 \]

Since \( L \) must be an integer, the maximum value for \( L \) is 12. Let's substitute \( L = 12 \) into the equation to find \( S \):

\[ 7(12) + 3S = 90 \]
\[ 84 + 3S = 90 \]
\[ 3S = 90 - 84 \]
\[ 3S = 6 \]
\[ S = 2 \]

So, if we have 12 large groups, we will have 2 small groups. To confirm that this is the smallest possible value for \( S \), we can check the next possible value for \( L \), which is 11:

\[ 7(11) + 3S = 90 \]
\[ 77 + 3S = 90 \]
\[ 3S = 90 - 77 \]
\[ 3S = 13 \]
\[ S = \frac{13}{3} \approx 4.3333 \]

16,16," To determine how many cups were filled with tea, we need to divide the total amount of tea by the amount of tea in each cup. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the total amount of tea in the pot, which is 1,050 ml.
2. Identify the amount of tea in each cup, which is 65 ml.
3. Divide the total amount of tea by the amount of tea in each cup to find out how many cups were filled.

The calculation is as follows:
\[ 1050 \div 65 \]

To perform the division, we can use long division. First, we see how many times 65 goes into 105. It goes in 1 time because \( 65 \times 1 = 65 \). We subtract 65 from 105 to get 40. Then, we bring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 400. Next, we see how many times 65 goes into 400. It goes in 6 times because \( 65 \times 6 = 390 \). We subtract 390 from 400 to get 10. Since 65 does not go into 10, we stop here.

So, the quotient is 16 with a remainder of 10. However, since we are asked how many cups were filled with tea, we only consider the whole number part of the quotient, which is 16.

Therefore, the number of cups filled with tea is \(\boxed{16}\).",The answer is 16,"There was 1,050 ml of tea in a pot. Anna poured the tea into some cups. If there were 65 ml of tea in each cup, how many cups were filled with tea?"

1. Calculate the total amount of tea poured into the cups.
2. Subtract the total amount of tea poured into the cups from the initial amount of tea in the pot.

First, let's find out how many cups Anna filled. Since each cup contains 65 ml of tea, we divide the initial amount of tea by the amount of tea per cup:
\[
\frac{1050 \text{ ml}}{65 \text{ ml/cup}} = 16.153846153846154

Since Anna can only fill whole cups, she filled 16 cups. Now, we calculate the total amount of tea poured into these 16 cups:
\[
16 \text{ cups} \times 65 \text{ ml/cup} = 1040 \text{ ml}
\]
Next, we subtract the total amount of tea poured into the cups from the initial amount of tea in the pot:
\[
1050 \text{ ml} - 1040 \text{ ml} = 10 \text{ ml}
\]
Therefore, the amount of tea left in the pot is \boxed{10}.",The answer is 10,"There was 1,050 ml of tea in a pot. Anna poured the tea into some cups. If there were 65 ml of tea in each cup, how much tea was left in the pot?"

Gil takes 12 vitamins per day, and there are 250 vitamins in the bottle. To find out how many days it takes for him to finish the bottle, we divide the total number of vitamins by the number of vitamins he takes per day:

\[ \text{Total days} = \frac{250}{12} \]

Performing the division, we get:

\[ \text{Total days} = 20.8333\ldots \]

Since Gil can't take a fraction of a day's worth of vitamins, we need to consider that he will finish the bottle on the 21st day. On the 21st day, he will have taken 12 vitamins each day for 20 days, and then he will take a fraction of 12 vitamins on the 21st day to finish the bottle.

**Step 2: Determine how many vitamins Gil takes on the day he finishes the bottle.**

First, calculate the total number of vitamins Gil takes in the first 20 days:

\[ \text{Vitamins taken in 20 days} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

Next, subtract the number of vitamins taken in the first 20 days from the total number of vitamins in the bottle to find out how many vitamins are left for the 21st day:

\[ \text{Vitamins left for the 21st day} = 250 - 240 = 10 \]

So, on the 21st day, Gil takes 10 vitamins.

**Step 3: Subtract the number of vitamins Gil takes on the day he finishes the bottle from his usual daily amount of 12 vitamins.**

\[ \text{Vitamins short} = 12 - 10 = 2 \]

Therefore, Gil is \(\boxed{2}\) vitamins short of his usual 12 vitamins on the day the bottle runs out.",The answer is 2,There are 250 vitamins in a bottle. Gil takes 12 vitamins per day. How many vitamins short of his usual 12 vitamins is Gil on the day the bottle runs out?
11,6," To determine how many more rabbits the farmer should buy to fill 17 cages with the same number of rabbits, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rabbits per cage if the farmer distributed the current number of rabbits equally among the cages.**

   The farmer has 164 rabbits and 17 cages. We perform the division:
   \[
   164 \div 17
   \]

   Using long division:
   - 17 goes into 164 nine times (since \(17 \times 9 = 153\)).
   - Subtract 153 from 164 to get a remainder:
     \[
     164 - 153 = 11
     \]

   So, when 164 rabbits are divided by 17 cages, each cage gets 9 rabbits with a remainder of 11 rabbits.

2. **Determine how many more rabbits are needed to fill all cages.**

   Since there is a remainder of 11 rabbits, we need enough additional rabbits to make up the difference to fill each cage completely. Each cage needs \(17 - 9 = 8\) more rabbits.

   Therefore, the total number of additional rabbits needed is:
   \[
   17 \times 8 - 164
   \]

   First, calculate \(17 \times 8\):
   \[
   17 \times 8 = 136
   \]

   Then, subtract the current number of rabbits:
   \[
   136 - 164 = 11
   \]

22,22," To determine how many more lollipops are needed so that all 42 kids can share them equally, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops each kid would get if they were distributed equally:**
   \[
   \text{Number of lollipops per kid} = \frac{650}{42}
   \]

2. **Perform the division to find the quotient and the remainder:**
   \[
   650 \div 42 \approx 15.476
   \]
   The integer part of the quotient is 15, which means each kid would get 15 lollipops if we were to distribute them equally without any remainder.

3. **Calculate the total number of lollipops distributed if each kid gets 15 lollipops:**

5,5," To determine how many more tarts Mrs. Dalloway should make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tarts per box:**
   Mrs. Dalloway wants to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts. We start by dividing the total number of tarts she currently has by the number of boxes.
   \[
   \frac{85}{10} = 8.5
   \]
   Since each box must contain a whole number of tarts, Mrs. Dalloway needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, each box should contain 9 tarts.

2. **Calculate the total number of tarts needed:**
   If each box contains 9 tarts and there are 10 boxes, we multiply the number of tarts per box by the number of boxes.
   \[
   9 \times 10 = 90
   \]
   So, Mrs. Dalloway needs a total of 90 tarts.

3. **Determine how many more tarts are needed:**
   Mrs. Dalloway currently has 85 tarts. To find out how many more tarts she needs, we subtract the number of tarts she has from the total number of tarts required.
   \[
   90 - 85 = 5
   \]

Therefore, Mrs. Dalloway should make \boxed{5} more tarts.",The answer is 5,"Mrs. Dalloway made 85 tarts. If she wants to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts, how many more tarts should she make?"
11,11," To determine how many more new books should be purchased so that the library can shelve them equally onto 83 shelves, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of books per shelf if the books are distributed equally:**
   \[
   \text{Books per shelf} = \frac{4305}{83}
   \]

2. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   4305 \div 83
   \]

   To do this division, we can use long division. Here's how it works:

   - **Step 1:** Determine how many times 83 goes into the first two digits of 4305. Since 83 goes into 430 five times (because \(83 \times 5 = 415\)), we write 5 above the line.
   - **Step 2:** Subtract 415 from 430 to get a remainder of 15.
   - **Step 3:** Bring down the next digit, which is 5, making it 155.
   - **Step 4:** Determine how many times 83 goes into 155. Since 83 goes into 155 once (because \(83 \times 1 = 83\)), we write 1 above the line next to the 5.
   - **Step 5:** Subtract 83 from 155 to get a remainder of 72.

   So, the quotient is 51 and the remainder is 72. This means:
   \[
   4305 \div 83 = 51 \text{ R } 72
   \]

3. **Determine how many more books are needed:**
   Since there is a remainder of 72, we need enough additional books to make the total number of books divisible by 83. The next whole number that is divisible by 83 after 4305 is \(83 \times 52\).

   Calculate \(83 \times 52\):
   \[
   83 \times 52 = 4316
   \]

4. **Find the difference between the next divisible number and the current number of books:**
   \[
   4316 - 4305 = 11
   \]

Therefore, the library needs to purchase \(\boxed{11}\) more new books to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves.",The answer is 11,"A library buys 4,305 new books. If it wants to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves, how many more new books should be purchased?"

10,10," To determine how much heavier a jade is than a diamond, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( d \) be the weight of one diamond in grams.
- Let \( j \) be the weight of one jade in grams.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 grams.
2. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 grams.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( 5d = 100 \)
2. \( 4d + 2j = 140 \)

Let's solve the first equation for \( d \):
\[ 5d = 100 \]
\[ d = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ d = 20 \]

Now that we know the weight of one diamond is 20 grams, we can substitute \( d = 20 \) into the second equation to find the weight of one jade:
\[ 4(20) + 2j = 140 \]
\[ 80 + 2j = 140 \]
\[ 2j = 140 - 80 \]
\[ 2j = 60 \]
\[ j = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ j = 30 \]

Now we know the weight of one jade is 30 grams. To find out how much heavier a jade is than a diamond, we subtract the weight of one diamond from the weight of one jade:
\[ j - d = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, a jade is \(\boxed{10}\) grams heavier than a diamond.",The answer is 10,The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the weight of one single bed in kilograms.
- \( y \) as the weight of one double bed in kilograms.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The weight of 5 single beds is 50 kg.
2. The total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( 5x = 50 \)
2. \( 2x + 4y = 100 \)

First, solve the first equation for \( x \):
\[ 5x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{5} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Now that we know the weight of one single bed is 10 kg, substitute \( x = 10 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(10) + 4y = 100 \]
\[ 20 + 4y = 100 \]

Next, isolate \( 4y \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4y = 100 - 20 \]
\[ 4y = 80 \]

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 grams.
2. The total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g.

We can convert 1 kg 50 g to grams:
\[ 1 \text{ kg} 50 \text{ g} = 1000 \text{ g} + 50 \text{ g} = 1050 \text{ g} \]

Now, we can set up the following system of equations:
1. \( 3g = 600 \)
2. \( 4g + 5p = 1050 \)

First, solve the first equation for \( g \):
\[ 3g = 600 \]
\[ g = \frac{600}{3} \]
\[ g = 200 \]

Now that we know the weight of one glass bottle is 200 grams, substitute \( g = 200 \) into the second equation:
\[ 4(200) + 5p = 1050 \]
\[ 800 + 5p = 1050 \]

Next, isolate \( 5p \) by subtracting 800 from both sides:
\[ 5p = 1050 - 800 \]
\[ 5p = 250 \]

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:
- \(50 = 2 \times 5^2\)
- \(25 = 5^2\)
- \(40 = 2^3 \times 5\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:

9:24,9:24," To determine when the three workers will start cutting trees at the same time again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their cutting times. The cutting times are 16 minutes for Worker X, 32 minutes for Worker Y, and 24 minutes for Worker C.

First, we find the prime factorizations of the numbers:
- \(16 = 2^4\)
- \(32 = 2^5\)
- \(24 = 2^3 \times 3\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^5\) (from 32).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^1\) (from 24).

Therefore, the LCM is:
\[
2^5 \times 3^1 = 32 \times 3 = 96
\]

The LCM of 16, 32, and 24 is 96. This means that the three workers will start cutting trees at the same time again after 96 minutes.

Next, we need to determine what time it will be 96 minutes after 7:48. We can break this down into hours and minutes:
- 96 minutes is 1 hour and 36 minutes (since \(96 \div 60 = 1\) hour and \(96 - 60 = 36\) minutes).

Adding 1 hour and 36 minutes to 7:48:
- Adding 1 hour to 7:48 gives us 8:48.
- Adding 36 minutes to 8:48 gives us 9:24.

Therefore, the three workers will start cutting trees at the same time again at \(\boxed{9:24}\).",The answer is 9:24,"Three workers are working to cut the trees. Worker X can cut a tree every 16 min, Worker Y every 32 min and Worker C every 24 min. If they start cutting three trees at the same time at 7:48, at what time will they start cutting trees at the same time again?"
15:55,15:55," To determine when the three carpenters will install doors at the same time again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their installation intervals. Let's convert all intervals to minutes for easier calculation.

- carpenter A installs a door every 40 minutes.
- carpenter B installs a door every 1 hour 20 minutes, which is \(1 \times 60 + 20 = 80\) minutes.
- carpenter C installs a door every 1 hour 40 minutes, which is \(1 \times 60 + 40 = 100\) minutes.

Next, we find the prime factorizations of these intervals:
- \(40 = 2^3 \times 5\)
- \(80 = 2^4 \times 5\)
- \(100 = 2^2 \times 5^2\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^4\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[
2^4 \times 5^2 = 16 \times 25 = 400 \text{ minutes}

The ratio of boys to girls is given by the fraction:
\[
\frac{425}{300}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 425 and 300. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

First, we perform the division of 425 by 300:
\[
425 \div 300 = 1 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 425 - 300 = 125
\]
So, we have:
\[
425 = 300 \cdot 1 + 125

Next, we divide 300 by 125:
\[
300 \div 125 = 2 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 300 - 125 \cdot 2 = 300 - 250 = 50
\]
So, we have:
\[

Then, we divide 125 by 50:
\[
125 \div 50 = 2 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 125 - 50 \cdot 2 = 125 - 100 = 25

2 \text{ bags of balloons,40," To determine how many bags of balloons, party horns, and candy bars Magellan should buy so that there are an equal number of each item in each basket, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 20, 10, and 8. The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers.

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:
- The prime factorization of 20 is \(20 = 2^2 \times 5\).
- The prime factorization of 10 is \(10 = 2 \times 5\).
- The prime factorization of 8 is \(8 = 2^3\).

Next, we identify the highest power of each prime number that appears in these factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\) (from 8).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^1\) (from 20 and 10).

The LCM is found by multiplying these highest powers together:
\[
\text{LCM} = 2^3 \times 5^1 = 8 \times 5 = 40

210,210," To determine how many days will pass before a full moon occurs again on a Friday, we need to consider both the periodicity of the full moon and the periodicity of the days of the week.

1. **Full Moon Periodicity**: A full moon occurs every 30 days.
2. **Days of the Week Periodicity**: There are 7 days in a week.

We need to find the smallest number of days \( x \) such that:
- \( x \) is a multiple of 30 (for the full moon to occur).
- \( x \) leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 7 (for the day of the week to be Friday again).

This can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ x \equiv 0 \pmod{30} \]
\[ x \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]

Since \( x \) must satisfy both congruences, \( x \) must be a common multiple of 30 and 7. The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both.

34,34," To determine how many cans Zachary will find on the seventh day, we need to identify the pattern in the number of cans he finds each day. Let's analyze the given data:

- On the first day, he found 4 cans.
- On the second day, he found 9 cans.
- On the third day, he found 14 cans.

We can observe that the number of cans increases by a constant difference each day. To find this difference, we subtract the number of cans found on the first day from the number of cans found on the second day:

\[ 9 - 4 = 5 \]

Next, we verify that this difference is consistent by subtracting the number of cans found on the second day from the number of cans found on the third day:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Since the difference is consistent, we can conclude that Zachary finds 5 more cans each day than he did the previous day. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 4 and the common difference \(d\) is 5.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

We need to find the number of cans Zachary will find on the seventh day (\(n = 7\)):

\[ a_7 = 4 + (7-1) \cdot 5 \]

First, we know that Tina gave 8 beanie babies to her cousin. So, the number of beanie babies left after giving some to her cousin is:
\[ x - 8 \]

Next, she gave half of the 8 beanie babies to her sister. Since half of 8 is 4, she gave 4 beanie babies to her sister. So, the number of beanie babies left after giving some to her sister is:
\[ x - 8 - 4 = x - 12 \]

Then, she gave 36 beanie babies to needy children. So, the number of beanie babies left after giving some to the needy children is:
\[ x - 12 - 36 = x - 48 \]

Finally, she kept 12 beanie babies for herself. So, the number of beanie babies left after keeping some for herself is:
\[ x - 48 - 12 = x - 60 \]

Since the number of beanie babies left after all these distributions is 0 (because she has no beanie babies left), we can set up the following equation:
\[ x - 60 = 0 \]

8,8," To determine how much more Anette weighs than Sara, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define the variables:
- \( A \) is Anette's weight.
- \( C \) is Caitlin's weight.
- \( S \) is Sara's weight.

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. \( A + C = 95 \)
2. \( C + S = 87 \)

We need to find the difference between Anette's weight and Sara's weight, which is \( A - S \).

First, we can solve the first equation for \( A \):
\[ A = 95 - C \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( A \) into the equation we will derive from the second equation. However, we can also eliminate \( C \) by subtracting the second equation from the first equation:
\[ (A + C) - (C + S) = 95 - 87 \]
\[ A + C - C - S = 8 \]
\[ A - S = 8 \]

1. The total number of apples in all three bags is 24.
2. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples.
3. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples.

We can translate this information into the following system of equations:
1. \( x + y + z = 24 \)
2. \( x + y = 11 \)
3. \( y + z = 18 \)

First, we can use the second equation to express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
\[ x = 11 - y \]

Next, we can use the third equation to express \( z \) in terms of \( y \):
\[ z = 18 - y \]

Now, we substitute these expressions for \( x \) and \( z \) into the first equation:
\[ (11 - y) + y + (18 - y) = 24 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 11 + 18 - y = 24 \]
\[ 29 - y = 24 \]

Solve for \( y \):
\[ 29 - 24 = y \]
\[ y = 5 \]

Now that we have the value of \( y \), we can find \( x \) and \( z \):
\[ x = 11 - y = 11 - 5 = 6 \]
\[ z = 18 - y = 18 - 5 = 13 \]

Thus, the total number of days it takes the worm to reach the top of the hole is \(\boxed{6}\).",The answer is 5,A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?
46,46," To determine the weight of Skeeter, we start by defining the weights of Rita, Peter, and Skeeter. Let's denote the weight of Rita as \( R \), the weight of Peter as \( P \), and the weight of Skeeter as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total weight of Rita, Peter, and Skeeter is 90 pounds.
2. Rita and Peter weigh the same amount.
3. Peter and Skeeter weigh 68 pounds together.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
1. \( R + P + S = 90 \)
2. \( R = P \)
3. \( P + S = 68 \)

First, we substitute \( R \) with \( P \) in the first equation:
\[ P + P + S = 90 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2P + S = 90 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 2P + S = 90 \)
2. \( P + S = 68 \)

To eliminate \( S \), we subtract the second equation from the first equation:
\[ (2P + S) - (P + S) = 90 - 68 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ P = 22 \]

Now that we know Peter weighs 22 pounds, we can substitute \( P = 22 \) back into the second equation to find \( S \):
\[ 22 + S = 68 \]
Subtracting 22 from both sides, we get:
\[ S = 46 \]

Therefore, Skeeter weighs \(\boxed{46}\) pounds.",The answer is 46,"Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?"

- \( T \) as the amount of money Tara had.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Tara had $4 more than Megan.
2. Together, Megan and Tara had enough money to buy the scooter, which costs $26.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
1. \( T = M + 4 \)
2. \( M + T = 26 \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ M + (M + 4) = 26 \]

Next, we combine like terms:

The GCD will give us the maximum number of stations that can be set up without any beverages left over.

The number of jugs of water is 16, and the number of jugs of sports drink is 12. We will use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 16 and 12.

1. Divide 16 by 12 and find the remainder:
   \[
   16 \div 12 = 1 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 16 - 12 \times 1 = 4
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[

First, we find the prime factorizations of 15 and 16:
- The prime factorization of 15 is \(15 = 3 \times 5\).
- The prime factorization of 16 is \(16 = 2^4\).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^4\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^1\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^1\).

Therefore, the LCM of 15 and 16 is:

60,60," To determine the smallest number of pens Philip can buy such that he has the same number of pens as pencils, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of pens per package (12) and the number of pencils per package (15).

**Step 1: Find the prime factorizations of 12 and 15.**

- The prime factorization of 12 is:
  \[
  12 = 2^2 \times 3
  \]

- The prime factorization of 15 is:
  \[
  15 = 3 \times 5
  \]

**Step 2: Identify the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.**

- The prime number 2 appears in the factorization of 12 with the highest power of \(2^2\).
- The prime number 3 appears in both factorizations with the highest power of \(3^1\).
- The prime number 5 appears in the factorization of 15 with the highest power of \(5^1\).

**Step 3: Multiply these highest powers together to find the LCM.**

First, we find the prime factorizations of 18 and 10:
\[
18 = 2 \times 3^2
\]
\[
10 = 2 \times 5
\]

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^1\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^2\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^1\).

Therefore, the LCM is:
\[
LCM = 2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 = 2 \times 9 \times 5 = 90
\]

This means the smallest number of ducks Heather could have observed is 90. To verify, we check that 90 is a multiple of both 18 and 10:
\[
90 \div 18 = 5 \quad \text{(an integer)}
\]
\[
90 \div 10 = 9 \quad \text{(an integer)}

4,4," To determine the greatest number of tables the event planner can set up, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of adults and the number of children. The GCD will give us the largest number of tables that can be formed with each table having the same combination of adults and children and no people left over.

The number of adults is 12, and the number of children is 20. We will use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 12 and 20.

1. Divide 20 by 12 and find the remainder:
   \[
   20 \div 12 = 1 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 20 - 12 \times 1 = 8
   \]
   So, \(20 = 12 \times 1 + 8\).

2. Now, divide 12 by 8 and find the remainder:
   \[
   12 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 12 - 8 \times 1 = 4
   \]
   So, \(12 = 8 \times 1 + 4\).

3. Next, divide 8 by 4 and find the remainder:
   \[
   8 \div 4 = 2 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 8 - 4 \times 2 = 0
   \]
   So, \(8 = 4 \times 2 + 0\).

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD of 12 and 20 is 4. Therefore, the greatest number of tables the planner can set up is 4.

To verify, if we divide the 12 adults and 20 children into 4 tables, each table will have:
\[
\frac{12}{4} = 3 \quad \text{adults}
\]
\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5 \quad \text{children}
\]
So, each table will have 3 adults and 5 children, and there will be no people left over.

The greatest number of tables the planner can set up is \(\boxed{4}\).",The answer is 4,"An event has 12 adults and 20 children. The event planner wants to make each table identical, with the same combination of adults and children and no people left over. What is the greatest number of tables the planner can set up?"
95,95," To determine the smallest number of bars and bottles of soap that Joe's Bath Shop could have sold last week, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( x \) such that the number of bars sold, \( 5a \), equals the number of bottles sold, \( 19b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers. This can be expressed as the equation:

\[ 5a = 19b \]

This equation tells us that \( 5a \) must be a multiple of 19, and \( 19b \) must be a multiple of 5. Therefore, \( a \) must be a multiple of 19, and \( b \) must be a multiple of 5. Let's express \( a \) and \( b \) in terms of their multiples:

\[ a = 19k \]
\[ b = 5k \]

for some positive integer \( k \). Substituting these expressions back into the equation \( 5a = 19b \), we get:

\[ 5(19k) = 19(5k) \]
\[ 95k = 95k \]

This equation is true for any positive integer \( k \). To find the smallest number of each type of soap sold, we choose the smallest positive integer for \( k \), which is 1. Therefore:

\[ a = 19 \cdot 1 = 19 \]
\[ b = 5 \cdot 1 = 5 \]

So, the smallest number of bars of soap sold is 95, and the smallest number of bottles of soap sold is 95. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{95} \]",The answer is 95,Joe's Bath Shop sells bars of soap in boxes of 5 bars and bottles of soap in boxes of 19 bottles. An employee is surprised to discover that the shop sold the same number of bars and bottles last week. What is the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold?
48,48," To determine how many more coins of the total than quarters Trevor has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the number of dimes:**
   - Trevor counted a total of 77 coins.
   - He counted 29 quarters.
   - The rest of the coins are dimes.
   - Therefore, the number of dimes is:
     \[
     77 - 29 = 48
     \]

2. **Calculate the difference between the total number of coins and the number of quarters:**
   - The total number of coins is 77.
   - The number of quarters is 29.
   - The difference is:

Thus, Trevor has \(\boxed{48}\) more coins of the total than quarters.",The answer is 48,Trevor counted 77 coins in his bank. He counted 29 quarters. The rest are dimes. How many more coints of the total than quarts does Trevor have?
37,37," To determine how many marbles Laurie has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. First, we know that Dennis has 70 marbles.
   \[
   \text{Dennis's marbles} = 70
   \]

2. Next, we are told that Kurt has 45 marbles less than Dennis. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Kurt has by subtracting 45 from Dennis's marbles.
   \[
   \text{Kurt's marbles} = 70 - 45 = 25
   \]

3. Finally, we are told that Laurie has 12 more marbles than Kurt. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Laurie has by adding 12 to Kurt's marbles.
   \[
   \text{Laurie's marbles} = 25 + 12 = 37
   \]

So, the number of marbles Laurie has is \boxed{37}.",The answer is 37,Laurie has 12 more marbles than Kurt. Kurt has 45 marbles less than Dennis. Dennis has 70 marbles. How many marbles does Laurie have?
12,12," To determine Sue's age, we start by noting the total sum of the ages of Kate, Maggie, and Sue, which is 48. We are given that Kate is 19 years old and Maggie is 17 years old. Let's denote Sue's age by \( S \).

First, we can write the equation for the sum of their ages:
\[
19 + 17 + S = 48
\]

Next, we combine the ages of Kate and Maggie:
\[
36 + S = 48
\]

To find Sue's age, we need to isolate \( S \) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 36 from both sides of the equation:
\[
S = 48 - 36
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:
\[
S = 12
\]

Therefore, Sue is \(\boxed{12}\) years old.",The answer is 12,"Kate, Maggie, and Sue added up their ages. The total was 48. Kate is 19 and Maggie is 17. How old is Sue?"
40,40," To determine the cost of the cupcake, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Anthony received for lunch over the days.
2. Subtract the cost of the juice box and the remaining money from the total amount to find the cost of the cupcake.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Anthony received for lunch. Since he gets 75 cents every day and we are not given the number of days, we will assume the problem implies he received the money for a certain period but the exact number of days is not necessary for the calculation of the cupcake cost directly from the given information.

However, we can infer from the problem that the total amount of money he received is the sum of the juice box cost, the cupcake cost, and the remaining money. Let's denote the cost of the cupcake as \( x \).

The total amount of money Anthony received is:
\[ 27 \text{ cents} + x + 8 \text{ cents} \]

This total amount is also equal to the amount he received over the days, but since the exact number of days is not specified, we can use the given information to find \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 75 \text{ cents} \times \text{number of days} = 27 \text{ cents} + x + 8 \text{ cents} \]

Since the exact number of days is not specified, we can use the logical approach to find \( x \) directly from the given information:
\[ 75 \text{ cents} \times \text{number of days} = 27 \text{ cents} + x + 8 \text{ cents} \]

We can use the logical approach to find \( x \) directly from the given information:
\[ 75 \text{ cents} \times \text{number of days} = 27 \text{ cents} + x + 8 \text{ cents}]

74,74," To determine how many games the toy store had after the given events, we can break down the problem into a series of simple steps:

1. Start with the initial number of games on the shelf.
2. Subtract the number of games sold in the first week.
3. Add the number of games received from the factory.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

1. The initial number of games on the shelf is 95.
2. The store sold 68 games in the first week. So, we subtract 68 from 95:
   \[
   95 - 68 = 27
   \]
   After selling 68 games, the store has 27 games left.
3. The store then received 47 more games from the factory. So, we add 47 to the remaining 27 games:

\text{men's track team,The," To determine which track team has a lower ratio of long-distance to short-distance runners, we need to calculate the ratio for both the women's and men's teams and then compare these ratios.

First, let's calculate the ratio for the women's track team:
- The number of women competing in long-distance events is 14.
- The number of women competing in short-distance events is 20.
- The ratio of long-distance to short-distance runners for the women's team is \(\frac{14}{20}\).

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[
\frac{14 \div 2}{20 \div 2} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio for the men's track team:
- The number of men competing in long-distance events is 10.
- The number of men competing in short-distance events is 16.
- The ratio of long-distance to short-distance runners for the men's team is \(\frac{10}{16}\).

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[
\frac{10 \div 2}{16 \div 2} = \frac{5}{8}
\]

Now, we need to compare the two simplified ratios \(\frac{7}{10}\) and \(\frac{5}{8}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 8 is 40. We will convert both fractions to have this common denominator.

For \(\frac{7}{10}\):
\[
\frac{7}{10} = \frac{7 \times 4}{10 \times 4} = \frac{28}{40}
\]

For \(\frac{5}{8}\):
\[
\frac{5}{8} = \frac{5 \times 5}{8 \times 5} = \frac{25}{40}
\]

Now we can compare \(\frac{28}{40}\) and \(\frac{25}{40}\). Since 28 is greater than 25, \(\frac{28}{40}\) is greater than \(\frac{25}{40}\). Therefore, the ratio \(\frac{7}{10}\) is greater than the ratio \(\frac{5}{8}\).

This means that the men's track team has a lower ratio of long-distance to short-distance runners.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{men's track team}}

- Simplifying this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2, we get \(\frac{10 \div 2}{16 \div 2} = \frac{5}{8}\).

Next, let's calculate the ratio of small-scale to large-scale events for the winter:
- In the winter, they catered 7 small-scale events and 12 large-scale events.
- The ratio of small-scale to large-scale events in the winter is \(\frac{7}{12}\).

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{5}{8}\) and \(\frac{7}{12}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 8 and 12 is 24.

Convert \(\frac{5}{8}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 24:
\[
\frac{5}{8} = \frac{5 \times 3}{8 \times 3} = \frac{15}{24}
\]

Convert \(\frac{7}{12}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 24:
\[
\frac{7}{12} = \frac{7 \times 2}{12 \times 2} = \frac{14}{24}
\]

Now, we compare \(\frac{15}{24}\) and \(\frac{14}{24}\). Since 15 is greater than 14, \(\frac{15}{24}\) is greater than \(\frac{14}{24}\). Therefore, the ratio of small-scale to large-scale events is higher in the fall.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{fall}}
\]",The answer is Fall,"In the fall, Ian's catering company catered 10 small-scale events and 16 large-scale events. In the winter, they catered 7 small-scale events and 12 large-scale ones. During which season did Ian's catering company cater a higher ratio of small-scale to large-scale events?"
Lisa's team,Lisa's," To determine which team had a higher ratio of wins to losses, we need to calculate the ratio of wins to losses for both Lisa's team and Susan's team.

First, let's calculate the ratio for Lisa's team:
- Lisa's team won 8 games.
- Lisa's team lost 6 games.
- The ratio of wins to losses for Lisa's team is \(\frac{8}{6}\).

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[
\frac{8 \div 2}{6 \div 2} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio for Susan's team:
- Susan's team won 17 games.
- Susan's team lost 14 games.
- The ratio of wins to losses for Susan's team is \(\frac{17}{14}\).

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 (since 17 and 14 are coprime):
\[
\frac{17 \div 1}{14 \div 1} = \frac{17}{14}
\]

Now, we need to compare the two simplified ratios \(\frac{4}{3}\) and \(\frac{17}{14}\). To do this, we can convert both fractions to decimal form:
\[
\frac{4}{3} \approx 1.3333
\]
\[
\frac{17}{14} \approx 1.2143
\]

Since 1.3333 is greater than 1.2143, the ratio \(\frac{4}{3}\) is greater than the ratio \(\frac{17}{14}\).

Therefore, Lisa's team had a higher ratio of wins to losses. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{Lisa's team}
\]",The answer is Lisa's,"Last season, Lisa's soccer team won 8 games and lost 6 games. Her cousin Susan's team won 17 games and lost 14 games. Which team had a higher ratio of wins to losses?"
Shannon,Shannon," To determine who baked a higher ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies, we need to calculate the ratio for each person and then compare the two ratios.

First, let's calculate the ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies for Ava:
Ava baked 14 apple pies and 8 blueberry pies. The ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies for Ava is:
\[
\frac{14}{8}
\]
We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[
\frac{14 \div 2}{8 \div 2} = \frac{7}{4}
\]
So, the ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies for Ava is \(\frac{7}{4}\).

Next, let's calculate the ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies for Shannon:
Shannon baked 12 apple pies and 4 blueberry pies. The ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies for Shannon is:
\[
\frac{12}{4}
\]
We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
\[
\frac{12 \div 4}{4 \div 4} = \frac{3}{1} = 3
\]
So, the ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies for Shannon is 3, which can also be written as \(\frac{3}{1}\).

Now, we compare the two ratios:
\[
\frac{7}{4} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3}{1}
\]
To compare these ratios, we can convert \(\frac{3}{1}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
\[
\frac{3}{1} = \frac{3 \times 4}{1 \times 4} = \frac{12}{4}
\]
Now we compare \(\frac{7}{4}\) and \(\frac{12}{4}\). Since 12 is greater than 7, \(\frac{12}{4}\) is greater than \(\frac{7}{4}\). Therefore, Shannon baked a higher ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{Shannon}
\]",The answer is Shannon,Ava and Shannon are baking pies for a bake sale. Ava baked 14 apple pies and 8 blueberry pies. Shannon baked 12 apple pies and 4 blueberry pies. Who baked a higher ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies?
Ezra's class,Ezra's," To determine which class has a higher ratio of pen users to pencil users, we need to calculate the ratio for each class and then compare the two ratios.

First, let's calculate the ratio for Ezra's class:
- The number of students who take notes in pen is 14.
- The number of students who take notes in pencil is 20.
- The ratio of pen users to pencil users in Ezra's class is \(\frac{14}{20}\).

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[
\frac{14 \div 2}{20 \div 2} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio for Jackson's class:
- The number of students who take notes in pen is 11.
- The number of students who take notes in pencil is 17.
- The ratio of pen users to pencil users in Jackson's class is \(\frac{11}{17}\).

Since 11 and 17 are both prime numbers, they do not have any common divisors other than 1, so the ratio \(\frac{11}{17}\) is already in its simplest form.

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{7}{10}\) and \(\frac{11}{17}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator or convert them to decimal form. Let's convert them to decimal form:
\[
\frac{7}{10} = 0.7
\]
\[
\frac{11}{17} \approx 0.647
\]

Since 0.7 is greater than 0.647, the ratio \(\frac{7}{10}\) is greater than the ratio \(\frac{11}{17}\).

Therefore, Ezra's class has a higher ratio of pen users to pencil users. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{Ezra's class}
\]",The answer is Ezra's,"In Ezra's class, 14 of the students take notes in pen and 20 take notes in pencil. In Jackson's class, 11 of the students take notes in pen and 17 take notes in pencil. Which class has a higher ratio of pen users to pencil users?"
Mrs. Doyle,Mrs.," To determine whose class had a higher ratio of students who preferred blue to students who preferred red, we need to calculate the ratio for each class and then compare the two ratios.

First, let's calculate the ratio for Mrs. Greer's class:
- Number of students who preferred blue: 8
- Number of students who preferred red: 14

The ratio of students who preferred blue to students who preferred red in Mrs. Greer's class is:
\[
\frac{8}{14}
\]

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[
\frac{8 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{4}{7}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio for Mrs. Doyle's class:
- Number of students who preferred blue: 10
- Number of students who preferred red: 13

The ratio of students who preferred blue to students who preferred red in Mrs. Doyle's class is:
\[
\frac{10}{13}
\]

Now, we need to compare the two ratios:
\[
\frac{4}{7} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{10}{13}
\]

To compare these fractions, we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 13 is 91. We will convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 91.

For \(\frac{4}{7}\):
\[
\frac{4}{7} = \frac{4 \times 13}{7 \times 13} = \frac{52}{91}
\]

For \(\frac{10}{13}\):
\[
\frac{10}{13} = \frac{10 \times 7}{13 \times 7} = \frac{70}{91}
\]

Now we compare \(\frac{52}{91}\) and \(\frac{70}{91}\):
\[
\frac{52}{91} < \frac{70}{91}
\]

Since \(\frac{70}{91}\) is greater than \(\frac{52}{91}\), Mrs. Doyle's class had a higher ratio of students who preferred blue to students who preferred red.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{Mrs. Doyle}
\]",The answer is Mrs.,"Mrs. Greer and Mrs. Doyle took polls of their second-grade classes to find out their students' favorite colors. In Mrs. Greer's class, 8 students said their favorite color was blue and 14 said their favorite color was red. In Mrs. Doyle's class, 10 voted for blue and 13 for red. Whose class had a higher ratio of students who preferred blue to students who preferred red?"
\text{Jacob's,Jacob's," To determine which recipe has a higher ratio of lemon-lime soda to pineapple juice, we need to calculate the ratio for each recipe and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the ratio for Jacob's punch recipe:
Jacob's recipe calls for 2 liters of lemon-lime soda and 4 liters of pineapple juice. The ratio of lemon-lime soda to pineapple juice is:
\[
\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio for Ella's punch recipe:
Ella's recipe requires 3 liters of lemon-lime soda and 7 liters of pineapple juice. The ratio of lemon-lime soda to pineapple juice is:
\[
\frac{3}{7}
\]

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{3}{7}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common denominator of 2 and 7 is 14. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 7}{2 \times 7} = \frac{7}{14}
\]
\[
\frac{3}{7} = \frac{3 \times 2}{7 \times 2} = \frac{6}{14}
\]

Now we compare \(\frac{7}{14}\) and \(\frac{6}{14}\). Since 7 is greater than 6, \(\frac{7}{14}\) is greater than \(\frac{6}{14}\). Therefore, \(\frac{1}{2}\) is greater than \(\frac{3}{7}\).

So, Jacob's punch recipe has a higher ratio of lemon-lime soda to pineapple juice. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{Jacob's}}
\]",The answer is Jacob's,Jacob's punch recipe calls for 2 liters of lemon-lime soda and 4 liters of pineapple juice. Ella's punch recipe requires 3 liters of lemon-lime soda and 7 liters of pineapple juice. Which recipe has a higher ratio of lemon-lime soda to pineapple juice?

- The number of 15-year-olds with black belts is 8.
- The number of 15-year-olds with brown belts is 20.
- The ratio of black belts to brown belts for the 15-year-olds is \(\frac{8}{20}\).

We can simplify \(\frac{8}{20}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
\[
\frac{8}{20} = \frac{8 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio of black belts to brown belts for the 16-year-olds:
- The number of 16-year-olds with black belts is 2.
- The number of 16-year-olds with brown belts is 5.
- The ratio of black belts to brown belts for the 16-year-olds is \(\frac{2}{5}\).

Now, we compare the two ratios:
- The ratio for the 15-year-olds is \(\frac{2}{5}\).
- The ratio for the 16-year-olds is \(\frac{2}{5}\).

Since both ratios are the same, neither age group has a lower ratio of black belts to brown belts. Therefore, the answer is:

\text{Daniel's pizza restaurant,Daniel's," To determine which restaurant uses a lower ratio of Parmesan to mozzarella, we need to calculate the ratio of Parmesan cheese to mozzarella for each restaurant and then compare these ratios.

First, let's calculate the ratio for Daniel's pizza restaurant:
- Daniel's pizza restaurant uses 2 kilograms of Parmesan cheese and 12 kilograms of mozzarella.
- The ratio of Parmesan to mozzarella is \(\frac{2}{12}\).
- Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
  \[
  \frac{2 \div 2}{12 \div 2} = \frac{1}{6}
  \]
- So, the ratio of Parmesan to mozzarella at Daniel's pizza restaurant is \(\frac{1}{6}\).

Next, let's calculate the ratio for Ethan's pizza restaurant:
- Ethan's pizza restaurant uses 5 kilograms of Parmesan cheese and 18 kilograms of mozzarella.
- The ratio of Parmesan to mozzarella is \(\frac{5}{18}\).
- Since 5 and 18 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction \(\frac{5}{18}\) is already in its simplest form.
- So, the ratio of Parmesan to mozzarella at Ethan's pizza restaurant is \(\frac{5}{18}\).

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{1}{6}\) and \(\frac{5}{18}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 18 is 18. We convert \(\frac{1}{6}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 18:
\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1 \times 3}{6 \times 3} = \frac{3}{18}
\]
Now we compare \(\frac{3}{18}\) and \(\frac{5}{18}\). Since 3 is less than 5, \(\frac{3}{18}\) is less than \(\frac{5}{18}\).

Therefore, Daniel's pizza restaurant uses a lower ratio of Parmesan to mozzarella. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{Daniel's pizza restaurant}}

First, let's calculate the ratio for last year:
- Last year, the event hall was used for 18 wedding receptions and 12 anniversary parties.
- The ratio of wedding receptions to anniversary parties last year is:
  \[
  \frac{18}{12}
  \]
- Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:
  \[
  \frac{18 \div 6}{12 \div 6} = \frac{3}{2}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the ratio for this year:
- This year, the event hall was used for 17 wedding receptions and 14 anniversary parties.
- The ratio of wedding receptions to anniversary parties this year is:
  \[
  \frac{17}{14}
  \]
- Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 (since 17 and 14 are coprime):
  \[
  \frac{17}{14}
  \]

Now, we compare the two ratios:
- Last year: \(\frac{3}{2}\)
- This year: \(\frac{17}{14}\)

To compare these fractions, we can convert them to decimal form:
- \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\)
- \(\frac{17}{14} \approx 1.2143\)

Since \(1.2143 < 1.5\), the ratio of wedding receptions to anniversary parties this year is lower than last year.

First, let's calculate the ratio of blue-eyed to brown-eyed students in Jesse's class:
- Jesse's class has 16 blue-eyed students and 12 brown-eyed students.
- The ratio of blue-eyed to brown-eyed students in Jesse's class is \(\frac{16}{12}\).
- We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
  \[
  \frac{16 \div 4}{12 \div 4} = \frac{4}{3}
  \]
- So, the ratio of blue-eyed to brown-eyed students in Jesse's class is \(\frac{4}{3}\).

Next, let's calculate the ratio of blue-eyed to brown-eyed students in Kimi's class:
- Kimi's class has 18 blue-eyed students and 15 brown-eyed students.
- The ratio of blue-eyed to brown-eyed students in Kimi's class is \(\frac{18}{15}\).
- We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:
  \[
  \frac{18 \div 3}{15 \div 3} = \frac{6}{5}
  \]
- So, the ratio of blue-eyed to brown-eyed students in Kimi's class is \(\frac{6}{5}\).

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{4}{3}\) and \(\frac{6}{5}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. We will convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 15:
- For \(\frac{4}{3}\), we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 5:

  \]
- For \(\frac{6}{5}\), we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3:
  \[
  \frac{6 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{18}{15}
  \]

Now we can compare \(\frac{20}{15}\) and \(\frac{18}{15}\). Since 20 is greater than 18, \(\frac{20}{15}\) is greater than \(\frac{18}{15}\). Therefore, the ratio of blue-eyed to brown-eyed students in Jesse's class is higher than the ratio in Kimi's class.

The final answer is \(\boxed{\text{Jesse's class}}\).",The answer is Jesse's,"In Jesse's class, 16 of the students have blue eyes and 12 have brown eyes. In Kimi's class, 18 of the students have blue eyes and 15 have brown eyes. Which class has a higher ratio of blue-eyed to brown-eyed students?"
\text{They have the same ratio,They," To determine who has a lower ratio of paper clips to rubber bands, we need to calculate the ratio for both Rina and Mia and then compare the two ratios.

First, let's calculate Rina's ratio of paper clips to rubber bands:
Rina has 18 paper clips and 12 rubber bands. The ratio is:
\[
\frac{18}{12}
\]
We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:

\frac{4,The," To determine which wedding had a higher ratio of guests of the groom to guests of the bride, we need to calculate the ratio for each wedding and then compare the two ratios.

First, let's calculate the ratio for the Cooper wedding:
- The number of guests on the groom's side is 12.
- The number of guests on the bride's side is 15.
- The ratio of guests of the groom to guests of the bride is \(\frac{12}{15}\).

To simplify \(\frac{12}{15}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 15, which is 3. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[
\frac{12 \div 3}{15 \div 3} = \frac{4}{5}
\]
So, the ratio of guests of the groom to guests of the bride at the Cooper wedding is \(\frac{4}{5}\).

Next, let's calculate the ratio for the Patterson wedding:
- The number of guests on the groom's side is 11.
- The number of guests on the bride's side is 14.
- The ratio of guests of the groom to guests of the bride is \(\frac{11}{14}\).

Since 11 and 14 have no common factors other than 1, the ratio \(\frac{11}{14}\) is already in its simplest form.

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{4}{5}\) and \(\frac{11}{14}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 14 is 70. We convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 70:
\[
\frac{4}{5} = \frac{4 \times 14}{5 \times 14} = \frac{56}{70}
\]
\[
\frac{11}{14} = \frac{11 \times 5}{14 \times 5} = \frac{55}{70}
\]

Now we compare \(\frac{56}{70}\) and \(\frac{55}{70}\). Since 56 is greater than 55, \(\frac{56}{70}\) is greater than \(\frac{55}{70}\). Therefore, \(\frac{4}{5}\) is greater than \(\frac{11}{14}\).

So, the Cooper wedding had a higher ratio of guests of the groom to guests of the bride. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{4}{5}}
\]",The answer is The,"At the Cooper wedding, 12 guests sat on the groom's side and 15 guests sat on the bride's side. At the Patterson wedding, 11 guests sat on the groom's side and 14 guests sat on the bride's side. Which wedding had a higher ratio of guests of the groom to guests of the bride?"
\text{first rest stop,The," To determine at which rest stop Lester counted a higher ratio of cars to trucks, we need to calculate the ratio of cars to trucks at each rest stop and then compare the two ratios.

First, let's calculate the ratio of cars to trucks at the first rest stop:
- Number of cars: 20
- Number of trucks: 18

The ratio of cars to trucks at the first rest stop is:
\[
\frac{20}{18}
\]

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 20 and 18 is 2.

\[
\frac{20 \div 2}{18 \div 2} = \frac{10}{9}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio of cars to trucks at the second rest stop:
- Number of cars: 17
- Number of trucks: 16

The ratio of cars to trucks at the second rest stop is:
\[
\frac{17}{16}
\]

Now, we compare the two simplified ratios:
- First rest stop: \(\frac{10}{9}\)
- Second rest stop: \(\frac{17}{16}\)

To compare these ratios, we can convert them to decimal form:
\[
\frac{10}{9} \approx 1.1111
\]
\[
\frac{17}{16} \approx 1.0625
\]

Since \(1.1111 > 1.0625\), the ratio of cars to trucks at the first rest stop is higher.

Therefore, the rest stop where Lester counted a higher ratio of cars to trucks is:
\[
\boxed{\text{first rest stop}}
\]",The answer is The,"During a road trip, Lester stopped at two rest stops. In the parking lot of the first rest stop, he counted 20 cars and 18 trucks. At the second rest stop, he counted 17 cars and 16 trucks. At which rest stop did Lester count a higher ratio of cars to trucks?"

- The number of gerbils at Westford is 12.
- The ratio of hamsters to gerbils at Westford is \(\frac{7}{12}\).

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{5}{6}\) and \(\frac{7}{12}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common denominator of 6 and 12 is 12.

Convert \(\frac{5}{6}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[
\frac{5}{6} = \frac{5 \times 2}{6 \times 2} = \frac{10}{12}
\]

Now we can compare \(\frac{10}{12}\) and \(\frac{7}{12}\):
\[
\frac{10}{12} > \frac{7}{12}
\]

Since \(\frac{10}{12}\) is greater than \(\frac{7}{12}\), the ratio of hamsters to gerbils at the Allville location is higher than the ratio at the Westford location. Therefore, the Westford location has a lower ratio of hamsters to gerbils.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{Westford}}
\]",The answer is Westford,A pet supply chain called Pet City has 5 hamsters and 6 gerbils for sale at its Allenville location. At its Westford location there are 7 hamsters and 12 gerbils. Which location has a lower ratio of hamsters to gerbils?
\text{both days,They," To determine on which day Tori caught a higher ratio of catfish to trout, we need to calculate the ratio of catfish to trout for each day and then compare the two ratios.

First, let's calculate the ratio of catfish to trout for the first day:
- Tori caught 5 catfish and 6 trout.
- The ratio of catfish to trout on the first day is \(\frac{5}{6}\).

Next, let's calculate the ratio of catfish to trout for the second day:
- Tori caught 10 catfish and 12 trout.
- The ratio of catfish to trout on the second day is \(\frac{10}{12}\).

We can simplify the ratio \(\frac{10}{12}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[
\frac{10}{12} = \frac{10 \div 2}{12 \div 2} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

Now we compare the two ratios:
- The ratio of catfish to trout on the first day is \(\frac{5}{6}\).
- The ratio of catfish to trout on the second day is \(\frac{5}{6}\).

Since both ratios are the same, Tori caught the same ratio of catfish to trout on both days.

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{\text{both days}}\).",The answer is They,"Tori went on a two-day fishing trip. On the first day, she caught 5 catfish and 6 trout. On the second day, she caught 10 catfish and 12 trout. On which day of the fishing trip did Tori catch a higher ratio of catfish to trout?"
Georgetown Middle School,Georgetown," To determine which middle school has a lower ratio of violin to flute players, we need to calculate the ratio for each school and then compare the two ratios.

First, let's calculate the ratio of violin to flute players for Georgetown Middle School:
- Number of violin players: 14
- Number of flute players: 12

The ratio of violin to flute players for Georgetown Middle School is:
\[
\frac{14}{12}
\]

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 14 and 12 is 2.

\[
\frac{14 \div 2}{12 \div 2} = \frac{7}{6}
\]

So, the simplified ratio for Georgetown Middle School is:
\[
\frac{7}{6}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio of violin to flute players for Seaside Middle School:
- Number of violin players: 6
- Number of flute players: 5

The ratio of violin to flute players for Seaside Middle School is:
\[
\frac{6}{5}
\]

Since \(\frac{6}{5}\) is already in its simplest form, we do not need to simplify it further.

Now, we compare the two ratios:
- ratio for Georgetown Middle School: \(\frac{7}{6}\)
- ratio for Seashore Middle School: \(\frac{6}{5}\)

To compare these fractions, we can convert them to decimal form:
\[
\frac{7}{6} \approx 1.1667
\]
\[
\frac{6}{5} = 1.2
\]

Since \(1.1667 < 1.2\), the ratio of violin to flute players at Georgetown Middle School is lower than the ratio at Seashore Middle School.

Therefore, the middle school with a lower ratio of violin to flute players is:
\[
\boxed{Georgetown Middle School}
\]",The answer is Georgetown,"Georgetown Middle School's orchestra has 14 violin players and 12 flute players. Seaside Middle School's orchestra, on the other hand, has 6 violin players and 5 flute players. Which middle school has a lower ratio of violin to flute players?"

2.5,2.5," To determine the price per pound of mulch, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the total weight of mulch from tons to pounds.
2. Divide the total cost by the total weight in pounds to find the price per pound.

**Step 1: Convert tons to pounds**

We know that:
\[ 1 \text{ ton} = 2000 \text{ pounds} \]

Given that we have 3 tons of mulch, we can convert this to pounds as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ tons} \times 2000 \text{ pounds/ton} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Divide the total cost by the total weight in pounds**

The total cost of 3 tons of mulch is $15,000.00. To find the price per pound, we divide the total cost by the total weight in pounds:

6,6," To determine the minimum number of coins Kira has, we need to find the combination of quarters and dimes that add up to $1.20 while using the fewest coins possible.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( q \) be the number of quarters.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.

The value of the quarters and dimes can be expressed in cents:
- Each quarter is worth 25 cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents.

The total value of the coins is given by the equation:
\[ 25q + 10d = 120 \]

We want to minimize the total number of coins, which is:
\[ q + d \]

To minimize \( q + d \), we should maximize the number of quarters because quarters have a higher value than dimes. Let's start by finding the maximum number of quarters that can be used.

If Kira uses only quarters:
\[ 25q = 120 \]
\[ q = \frac{120}{25} = 4.8 \]

Since \( q \) must be an integer, Kira cannot use 4.8 quarters. Therefore, we try the next lower integer, which is 4 quarters.

If Kira uses 4 quarters:
\[ 25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ cents} \]
\[ 120 - 100 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

The remaining 20 cents can be made up of dimes:
\[ 10d = 20 \]
\[ d = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \]

So, if Kira uses 4 quarters and 2 dimes, the total number of coins is:
\[ q + d = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

To confirm that this is the minimum number of coins, we check if using fewer quarters results in a higher number of coins.

If Kira uses 3 quarters:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \text{ cents} \]
\[ 120 - 75 = 45 \text{ cents} \]

The remaining 45 cents can be made up of dimes:
\[ 10d = 45 \]
\[ d = \frac{45}{10} = 4.5 \]

Since \( d \) must be an integer, Kira cannot use 4.5 dimes. Therefore, she would need to use 5 dimes.

If Kira uses 3 quarters and 5 dimes, the total number of coins is:
\[ q + d = 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Using fewer than 3 quarters results in more coins than using 4 quarters and 2 dimes.

Thus, the minimum number of coins Kira has is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]",The answer is 6,Kira has $1.20 in quarters and dimes. She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?
1121,1121," To determine how many more crayons Willy has than Lucy, we need to subtract the number of crayons Lucy has from the number of crayons Willy has. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the number of crayons Willy has: 5,092.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Convert the end time of the call (1:06 a.m.) into a format that makes it easier to subtract the duration. Since 1:06 a.m. is the same as 13:06 in 24-hour format, we can use this format for our calculation.

2. Subtract the duration of the call from the end time. The call lasted 1 hour and 21 minutes, which is the same as 13 minutes in minutes format (1 hour = 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 21 minutes = 60 + 21 = 81 minutes).

   First, subtract the minutes:
   \[
   66 - 21 = 45

\]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( C \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
\frac{7}{3}I - I = 20
\]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\frac{7}{3}I\) and \(I\) is 3. So, we can rewrite \(I\) as \(\frac{3}{3}I\):

\[
\frac{7}{3}I - \frac{3}{3}I = 20
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{4}{3}I = 20
\]

To solve for \( I \), we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{4}{3}\), which is \(\frac{3}{4}\):

\[
I = 20 \times \frac{3}{4} = 15

\[
\frac{m + 63}{m} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can cross-multiply:

\[
2(m + 63) = 9m
\]

Next, we distribute the 2 on the left side of the equation:

\[
2m + 126 = 9m
\]

To isolate \( m \), we subtract \( 2m \) from both sides of the equation:

\[
126 = 7m
\]

Now, we solve for \( m \) by dividing both sides by 7:

\[
m = 18

117,117," To determine how many times Kevin will dribble the basketball in 27 seconds, we start by finding his dribbling rate in times per second. We know that Kevin can dribble 13 times in 3 seconds. Therefore, his dribbling rate is:

\[
\text{Dribbling rate} = \frac{13 \text{ times}}{3 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{13}{3} \text{ times per second}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many times Kevin will dribble the basketball in 27 seconds. We do this by multiplying his dribbling rate by the total number of seconds:

\[
\text{Total dribbles in 27 seconds} = \left(\frac{13}{3} \text{ times per second}\right) \times 27 \text{ seconds}

\[
\text{Cleaning rate} = \frac{6 \text{ apartments}}{2.5 \text{ hours}}
\]

To simplify this, we can divide 6 by 2.5. One way to do this is to convert 2.5 to a fraction:

\[
2.5 = \frac{5}{2}
\]

So the cleaning rate becomes:

\[
\text{Cleaning rate} = 6 \div \frac{5}{2} = 6 \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4 \text{ apartments per hour}
\]

Now that we know Aarav's cleaning rate is 2.4 apartments per hour, we can find out how long it will take him to clean 30 apartments by dividing the total number of apartments by his cleaning rate:

\[
\text{Time to clean 30 apartments} = \frac{30 \text{ apartments}}{2.4 \text{ apartments per hour}}
\]

To simplify this division, we can convert 2.4 to a fraction:

\[
2.4 = \frac{12}{5}
\]

So the time becomes:

\[
\text{Time to clean 30 apartments} = 30 \div \frac{12}{5} = 30 \times \frac{5}{12} = \frac{150}{12} = 12.5 \text{ hours}

\frac{4,1.33," To determine how many hours it took Hanson to get to work, we need to calculate the difference between the time he arrived and the time he left.

1. Hanson left for work at 6:00 AM.
2. Hanson arrived at work at 7:20 AM.

We can break down the time difference into two parts:
- From 6:00 AM to 7:00 AM is 1 hour.
- From 7:00 AM to 7:20 AM is 20 minutes.

Since we need the answer in hours, we convert the 20 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the two parts together:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate Mabel's ratio of individuals to families:
- Mabel photographed 17 individuals.
- Mabel photographed 7 families.
- The ratio of individuals to families for Mabel is \(\frac{17}{7}\).

To simplify \(\frac{17}{7}\), we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 (since 17 is a prime number and does not divide 7):
\[
\frac{17 \div 1}{7 \div 1} = \frac{17}{7}
\]

Now, we compare the two ratios:
- Ella's ratio is \(\frac{3}{2}\).
- Mabel's ratio is \(\frac{17}{7}\).

To compare these ratios, we can convert them to decimal form:
- \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\)

\text{Adams County College,Adams," To determine which college has classes with a lower ratio of men to women, we need to calculate the ratio of men to women for each college and then compare the two ratios.

First, let's calculate the ratio of men to women for Greenpoint Technical College:
- The number of men in Greenpoint Technical College is 5.
- The number of women in Greenpoint Technical College is 6.
- The ratio of men to women is \(\frac{5}{6}\).

Next, let's calculate the ratio of men to women for Adams County College:
- The number of men in Adams County College is 15.
- The number of women in Adams County College is 19.
- The ratio of men to women is \(\frac{15}{19}\).

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{5}{6}\) and \(\frac{15}{19}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator or cross-multiply to compare the fractions directly.

Let's cross-multiply:
- For \(\frac{5}{6}\) and \(\frac{15}{19}\), we multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction and the numerator of the second fraction by the denominator of the first fraction.
- This gives us \(5 \times 19 = 95\) and \(15 \times 6 = 90\).

Since \(95 > 90\), it means that \(\frac{5}{6} > \frac{15}{19}\). Therefore, the ratio of men to women at Adams County College is lower than the ratio of men to women at Greenpoint Technical College.

The college with classes that have a lower ratio of men to women is \(\boxed{\text{Adams County College}}\).",The answer is Adams,"While researching colleges, Kendall learns that a typical class at Greenpoint Technical College has 5 men and 6 women, and a typical class at Adams County College has 15 men and 19 women.

First, let's calculate Jenna's ratio of cardio to resistance training:
- Jenna spends 18 minutes doing cardio.
- Jenna spends 20 minutes doing resistance training.
- The ratio of cardio to resistance training for Jenna is \(\frac{18}{20}\).

To simplify \(\frac{18}{20}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 20, which is 2. We then divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[
\frac{18 \div 2}{20 \div 2} = \frac{9}{10}
\]
So, Jenna's ratio of cardio to resistance training is \(\frac{9}{10}\).

Next, let's calculate Leon's ratio of cardio to resistance training:
- Leon spends 17 minutes doing cardio.
- Leon spends 18 minutes doing resistance training.
- The ratio of cardio to resistance training for Leon is \(\frac{17}{18}\).

To compare the two ratios \(\frac{9}{10}\) and \(\frac{17}{18}\), we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 10 and 18 is 90. We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{9}{10} = \frac{9 \times 9}{10 \times 9} = \frac{81}{90}
\]
\[
\frac{17}{18} = \frac{17 \times 5}{18 \times 5} = \frac{85}{90}
\]

Now we compare \(\frac{81}{90}\) and \(\frac{85}{90}\). Since 85 is greater than 81, \(\frac{85}{90}\) is greater than \(\frac{81}{90}\). Therefore, Leon does a higher ratio of cardio to resistance training.

Next, let's calculate the ratio of carrots to potatoes for Richard's recipe:
Richard's recipe requires 4 kilograms of carrots and 5 kilograms of potatoes. The ratio of carrots to potatoes is:
\[
\frac{4}{5}
\]

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{4}{5}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common denominator of 2 and 5 is 10. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 5}{2 \times 5} = \frac{5}{10}
\]
\[
\frac{4}{5} = \frac{4 \times 2}{5 \times 2} = \frac{8}{10}
\]

Now we can compare \(\frac{5}{10}\) and \(\frac{8}{10}\). Since 8 is greater than 5, \(\frac{8}{10}\) is greater than \(\frac{5}{10}\). Therefore, \(\frac{4}{5}\) is greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\).

So, Richard's recipe has a higher ratio of carrots to potatoes. The final answer is:

\frac{20 \div 4}{16 \div 4} = \frac{5}{4}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio of A's to B's in Mr. Hoover's Social Studies class:
- Number of A's: 13
- Number of B's: 10

The ratio of A's to B's in the Social Studies class is:
\[
\frac{13}{10}
\]

Now, we compare the two ratios:
- History class: \(\frac{5}{4}\)
- Social Studies class: \(\frac{13}{10}\)

To compare these ratios, we can convert them to decimal form:
- \(\frac{5}{4} = 1.25\)
- \(\frac{13}{10} = 1.3\)

Since \(1.25 < 1.3\), the ratio of A's to B's in the History class is lower than the ratio in the Social Studies class.

Therefore, Mr. Hoover gave out a lower ratio of A's to B's in \boxed{\text{History}}.",The answer is History,"In Mr. Hoover's History class, 20 of the students received A's and 16 received B's. In his Social Studies class, 13 of the students got A's and 10 got B's. In which class did Mr. Hoover give out a lower ratio of A's to B's?"
\text{Yardley,Yardley," To determine in which city the restaurant critic gave a higher ratio of positive to negative reviews, we need to calculate the ratio of positive reviews to negative reviews for both Richmond and Yardley.

First, let's calculate the ratio for Richmond:
- The number of positive reviews in Richmond is 14.
- The number of negative reviews in Richmond is 20.
- The ratio of positive to negative reviews in Richmond is \(\frac{14}{20}\).

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[
\frac{14 \div 2}{20 \div 2} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio for Yardley:
- The number of positive reviews in Yardley is 12.
- The number of negative reviews in Yardley is 17.
- The ratio of positive to negative reviews in Yardley is \(\frac{12}{17}\).

Since 17 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 12 other than 1, the ratio \(\frac{12}{17}\) is already in its simplest form.

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{7}{10}\) and \(\frac{12}{17}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator or convert them to decimal form.

Let's convert both ratios to decimal form:
\[
\frac{7}{10} = 0.7
\]
\[
\frac{12}{17} \approx 0.7058823529411765
\]

Since 0.7058823529411765 is greater than 0.7, the ratio \(\frac{12}{17}\) is greater than \(\frac{7}{10}\).

Therefore, the restaurant critic gave a higher ratio of positive to negative reviews in Yardley.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{Yardley}}
\]",The answer is Yardley,"A restaurant critic reviewed restaurants in Richmond and Yardley. In Richmond, the critic gave 14 positive reviews and 20 negative reviews. In Yardley, 12 of the reviews were positive and 17 were negative. In which city did the restaurant critic give a higher ratio of positive to negative reviews?"
\text{same,They," To determine which grade has a higher ratio of kickball players to four-square players, we need to calculate the ratio for each grade separately and then compare the two ratios.

First, let's calculate the ratio of kickball players to four-square players for the third graders:
- The number of third graders who play kickball is 12.
- The number of third graders who play four-square is 16.
- The ratio of kickball players to four-square players for the third graders is \(\frac{12}{16}\).

To simplify \(\frac{12}{16}\), we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
\[
\frac{12 \div 4}{16 \div 4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio of kickball players to four-square players for the fourth graders:
- The number of fourth graders who play kickball is 15.
- The number of fourth graders who play four-square is 20.
- The ratio of kickball players to four-square players for the fourth graders is \(\frac{15}{20}\).

To simplify \(\frac{15}{20}\), we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:
\[
\frac{15 \div 5}{20 \div 5} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Now, we compare the two ratios:
- The ratio of kickball players to four-square players for the third graders is \(\frac{3}{4}\).
- The ratio of kickball players to four-square players for the fourth graders is \(\frac{3}{4}\).

Since both ratios are the same, there is not a higher ratio in either grade. Therefore, the answer is:

\boxed{\text{same}}",The answer is They,"Among the third graders at Lanberry Elementary School, 12 play kickball during recess and 16 play four square.

Jake's stables,Jake's," To determine where there is a lower ratio of stallions to mares, we need to calculate the ratio for each stables and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the ratio of stallions to mares at Jake's stables:
- Jake's stables have 10 stallions and 15 mares.
- The ratio of stallions to mares is \(\frac{10}{15}\).

To simplify \(\frac{10}{15}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 15, which is 5. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5:
\[
\frac{10 \div 5}{15 \div 5} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio of stallions to mares at Bridget's stables:
- Bridget's stables have 17 stallions and 18 mares.
- The ratio of stallions to mares is \(\frac{17}{18}\).

Since 17 and 18 have no common factors other than 1, \(\frac{17}{18}\) is already in its simplest form.

Now, we compare the two ratios:
- Jake's stables: \(\frac{2}{3}\)
- Bridget's stables: \(\frac{17}{18}\)

To compare these fractions, we can convert them to decimal form:
- \(\frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667\)
- \(\frac{17}{18} \approx 0.9444\)

Since \(0.6667 < 0.9444\), the ratio of stallions to mares is lower at Jake's stables.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{Jake's stables}
\]",The answer is Jake's,At Jake's stables there are 10 stallions and 15 mares. At Bridget's stables there are 17 stallions and 18 mares. Where is there a lower ratio of stallions to mares?
\text{Ivan,Ivan," To determine who had a higher ratio of time spent watching TV to time spent reading, we need to calculate the ratio for both Ivan and Brenna and then compare the two ratios.

First, let's calculate Ivan's ratio of time spent watching TV to time spent reading:
\[
\text{Ivan's ratio} = \frac{\text{time spent watching TV}}{\text{time spent reading}} = \frac{20}{14}
\]
We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[
\frac{20 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{10}{7}
\]
So, Ivan's ratio is \(\frac{10}{7}\).

Next, let's calculate Brenna's ratio of time spent watching TV to time spent reading:
\[
\text{Brenna's ratio} = \frac{\text{time spent watching TV}}{\text{time spent reading}} = \frac{11}{10}
\]
Brenna's ratio is already in its simplest form, so it remains \(\frac{11}{10}\).

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{10}{7}\) and \(\frac{11}{10}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 10 is 70. We convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 70:
\[
\frac{10}{7} = \frac{10 \times 10}{7 \times 10} = \frac{100}{70}
\]
\[
\frac{11}{10} = \frac{11 \times 7}{10 \times 7} = \frac{77}{70}
\]
Now we compare \(\frac{100}{70}\) and \(\frac{77}{70}\). Since 100 is greater than 77, \(\frac{100}{70}\) is greater than \(\frac{77}{70}\). Therefore, Ivan had a higher ratio of time spent watching TV to time spent reading.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{Ivan}}
\]",The answer is Ivan,"Last month, Ivan spent 20 hours watching TV and 14 hours reading. The same month, Brenna spent 11 hours watching TV and 10 hours reading. Who had a higher ratio of time spent watching TV to time spent reading?"
27,27," To determine the number of carrot cakes the bakery will make in February, we need to identify the pattern in the number of carrot cakes baked each month. Let's analyze the given data:

- October: 19 carrot cakes
- November: 21 carrot cakes
- December: 23 carrot cakes
- January: 25 carrot cakes

We observe that the number of carrot cakes increases by 2 each month. To confirm this pattern, we can calculate the difference between consecutive months:

- November - October: \(21 - 19 = 2\)
- December - November: \(23 - 21 = 2\)
- January - December: \(25 - 23 = 2\)

Since the difference is consistently 2, we can conclude that the pattern is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.

To find the number of carrot cakes baked in February, we add the common difference to the number of carrot cakes baked in January:

\[
25 + 2 = 27
\]

Therefore, the bakery will make \(\boxed{27}\) carrot cakes in February.",The answer is 27,"Sweet Time Bakery just opened and is increasing the number of items they bake.

We observe that the number of text messages doubles each month. Let's verify this pattern:

- From November to December: \(1 \times 2 = 2\)
- From December to January: \(2 \times 2 = 4\)
- From January to February: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)

Since the pattern holds, we can predict the number of text messages for March by doubling the number of text messages in February:

19,19," To determine how many berries Malia will pick from the fifth bush, we need to identify the pattern in the number of berries she picks from each bush. Let's list the number of berries picked from each bush:

- First bush: 3 berries
- Second bush: 4 berries
- Third bush: 7 berries
- Fourth bush: 12 berries

Next, we observe the differences between the number of berries picked from consecutive bushes:

- The difference between the second bush and the first bush is \(4 - 3 = 1\).
- The difference between the third bush and the second bush is \(7 - 4 = 3\).
- The difference between the fourth bush and the third bush is \(12 - 7 = 5\).

We notice that the differences form a sequence of odd numbers: 1, 3, 5. The next odd number in this sequence is 7. Therefore, the number of berries picked from the fifth bush will be the number of berries picked from the fourth bush plus 7:

\[12 + 7 = 19\]

Thus, the number of berries Malia will pick from the fifth bush is \(\boxed{19}\).",The answer is 19,"Malia is picking berries in the berry patch.

- April: 5 pieces of mail
- May: 10 pieces of mail
- June: 20 pieces of mail
- July: 40 pieces of mail

We observe that the number of pieces of mail sent each month is increasing. To find the pattern, we can calculate the ratio of the number of pieces of mail sent in each month to the number of pieces of mail sent in the previous month:

- May: \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \)
- June: \( \frac{20}{10} = 2 \)
- July: \( \frac{40}{20} = 2 \)

We see that the number of pieces of mail sent each month is double the number of pieces of mail sent in the previous month. Therefore, the pattern is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.

To find the number of pieces of mail Vivian will send in August, we multiply the number of pieces of mail sent in July by the common ratio:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Thus, the number of pieces of mail Vivian will send in August is \(\boxed{80}\).",The answer is 80,"Vivian sent 5 pieces of mail in April, 10 pieces of mail in May, 20 pieces of mail in June, and 40 pieces of mail in July.

- First bin: 2 cans
- Second bin: 4 cans
- Third bin: 7 cans
- Fourth bin: 11 cans
- Fifth bin: 16 cans

We can see that the number of cans in each bin is increasing. To find the pattern, let's calculate the difference between the number of cans in consecutive bins:

- Second bin - First bin: \(4 - 2 = 2\)
- Third bin - Second bin: \(7 - 4 = 3\)
- Fourth bin - Third bin: \(11 - 7 = 4\)
- Fifth bin - Fourth bin: \(16 - 11 = 5\)

- Sunday: 4 sit-ups
- Monday: 8 sit-ups
- Tuesday: 16 sit-ups
- Wednesday: 32 sit-ups

- The first student received 3 note cards.
- The second student received 12 note cards.
- The third student received 48 note cards.
- The fourth student received 192 note cards.

We can observe that each term in the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor. Let's find this constant factor by dividing each term by the previous term:

\[
\frac{12}{3} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{48}{12} = 4

13,13," To determine the number of magazines Blanca will put in the fifth pile, we need to identify the pattern in the number of magazines in each pile. Let's analyze the given information:

- First pile: 3 magazines
- Second pile: 4 magazines
- Third pile: 6 magazines
- Fourth pile: 9 magazines

We can observe that the number of magazines in each pile is increasing. To find the pattern, let's look at the differences between consecutive piles:

- Second pile - First pile: \(4 - 3 = 1\)
- Third pile - Second pile: \(6 - 4 = 2\)
- Fourth pile - Third pile: \(9 - 6 = 3\)

The differences between consecutive piles are increasing by 1 each time. This suggests that the number of magazines in each pile follows a quadratic pattern. Let's express the number of magazines in the \(n\)-th pile as a function of \(n\).

We can use the general form of a quadratic function: \(a_n = an^2 + bn + c\).

We know the values of \(a_n\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, 4\):
- For \(n = 1\): \(a_1 = 3\)
- For \(n = 2\): \(a_2 = 4\)
- For \(n = 3\): \(a_3 = 6\)
- For \(n = 4\): \(a_4 = 9\)

We can set up a system of equations based on these values:

1. \(a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 3\)
2. \(a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 4\)
3. \(a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 6\)
4. \(a(4)^2 + b(4) + c = 9\)

Simplifying these equations, we get:

1. \(a + b + c = 3\)
2. \(4a + 2b + c = 4\)
3. \(9a + 3b + c = 6\)
4. \(16a + 4b + c = 9\)

We can solve this system step by step. First, subtract the first equation from the second:

\[
(4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 4 - 3
\]
\[
3a + b = 1 \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]

Next, subtract the second equation from the third:

\[
(9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 6 - 4
\]
\[
5a + b = 2 \quad \text{(Equation 6)}
\]

Then, subtract the third equation from the fourth:

\[
(16a + 4b + c) - (9a + 3b + c) = 9 - 6
\]
\[
7a + b = 3 \quad \text{(Equation 7)}
\]

Now, subtract Equation 5 from Equation 6:

\[
(5a + b) - (3a + b) = 2 - 1
\]
\[
2a = 1
\]
\[
a = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Substitute \(a = \frac{1}{2}\) back into Equation 5:

\[
3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + b = 1
\]
\[
\frac{3}{2} + b = 1
\]
\[
b = 1 - \frac{3}{2}
\]
\[
b = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

Substitute \(a = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(b = -\frac{1}{2}\) back into Equation 1:

\[
\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} + c = 3
\]
\[
c = 3
\]

Thus, the quadratic function is:

\[
a_n = \frac{1}{2}n^2 - \frac{1}{2}n + 3
\]

To find the number of magazines in the fifth pile (\(n = 5\)):

\[
a_5 = \frac{1}{2}(5)^2 - \frac{1}{2}(5) + 3
\]
\[
a_5 = \frac{1}{2}(25) - \frac{1}{2}(5) + 3

- \(1 = 3^0\)
- \(3 = 3^1\)
- \(9 = 3^2\)
- \(27 = 3^3\)
- \(81 = 3^4\)

The pattern shows that the number of buttons in the \(n\)-th box is \(3^{n-1}\). To find the number of buttons in the sixth box, we substitute \(n = 6\) into the pattern:
\[3^{6-1} = 3^5\]

60,60," To determine how many cherries Christine will put in the sixth bowl, we need to identify the pattern in the number of cherries in each bowl. Let's analyze the given information:

- First bowl: 35 cherries
- Second bowl: 40 cherries
- Third bowl: 45 cherries
- Fourth bowl: 50 cherries
- Fifth bowl: 55 cherries

We observe that the number of cherries in each bowl increases by 5 compared to the previous bowl. This is an arithmetic sequence where the common difference \(d\) is 5.

To find the number of cherries in the sixth bowl, we can use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]
where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term (the number of cherries in the \(n\)-th bowl),
- \(a_1\) is the first term (the number of cherries in the first bowl),
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

In this problem:
- \(a_1 = 35\),
- \(d = 5\),
- \(n = 6\).

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
a_6 = 35 + (6-1) \cdot 5
\]

127,255," To determine the minimum number of adults attending the school event, we need to find the smallest number that is a common multiple of both 17 (the number of adults per group) and 15 (the number of children per group). This number is the least common multiple (LCM) of 17 and 15.

First, we note that 17 and 15 are coprime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. The LCM of two coprime numbers is simply their product. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{LCM}(17, 15) = 17 \times 15
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[
17 \times 15 = 255
\]

This means that the smallest number of people (both adults and children) that can be seated such that there are the same number of adults as children is 255. Since the number of adults is equal to the number of children, we divide 255 by 2 to find the number of adults:

\[
\text{Number of adults} = \frac{255}{2} = 127.5
\]

However, since the number of adults must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate our approach. The correct approach is to find the LCM of 17 and 15 and then divide by 2 to find the number of adults.

748,748," To determine the smallest number of butterflies Kristen could have seen, we need to find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 44 and 17. This integer is the least common multiple (LCM) of 44 and 17.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 44 and 17:
- The prime factorization of 44 is \(44 = 2^2 \times 11\).
- The prime factorization of 17 is \(17 = 17\).

Since 17 is a prime number and does not appear in the factorization of 44, the LCM of 44 and 17 is the product of all the prime factors involved:

The packs of strawberry gum contain 6 pieces each, and the packs of blueberry gum contain 5 pieces each. Therefore, we need to find the LCM of 6 and 5.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 6 and 5:
- The prime factorization of 6 is \(6 = 2 \times 3\).
- The prime factorization of 5 is \(5 = 5\).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations. Here, the prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5. The highest power of 2 in the factorizations is \(2^1\), the highest power of 3 is \(3^1\), and the highest power of 5 is \(5^1\). Therefore, the LCM is:
\[
LCM = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 = 30
\]

This means that the smallest number of pieces of each type of gum that Linda must buy is 30. To verify, we can check how many packs of each type of gum she needs to buy:
- For strawberry gum, she needs \(30 \div 6 = 5\) packs.

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^2\).
- The highest power of 19 is \(19^1\).
- The highest power of 11 is \(11^1\).

Therefore, the LCM of 38 and 44 is:
\[
2^2 \times 19 \times 11 = 4 \times 19 \times 11
\]

We calculate this step by step:
\[
4 \times 19 = 76

1. Calculate the total number of bottles Bianca wants to drink in a week.
2. Subtract the number of bottles she has already bought from the total number of bottles she wants to drink.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles Bianca wants to drink in a week. Since she wants to drink 5 bottles each day and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 5 by 7:
\[ 5 \times 7 = 35 \]

Next, we subtract the number of bottles she has already bought from the total number of bottles she wants to drink. Bianca has bought 47 bottles, but we need to find out how many more she needs to buy to reach her goal of 35 bottles. However, since she has already bought more than she needs, we need to find out how many she has extra:
\[ 47 - 35 = 12 \]

Since Bianca has already bought 12 more bottles than she needs, she does not need to buy any more bottles on the last day. Therefore, the number of additional bottles she needs to buy on the last day is:

3. Calculate the total number of pieces of pepperoni used if we assume all pizzas are made.
4. Subtract the total number of pieces of pepperoni used from the total number of pieces of pepperoni available to find the extra pieces.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The total number of pieces of pepperoni available is 11.
2. Each pizza gets 2 pieces of pepperoni.
3. To find out how many pizzas can be made with 11 pieces of pepperoni, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pizza:
   \[
   \frac{11}{2} = 5 \text{ pizzas with 1 piece left over}
   \]
   This means that 5 pizzas can be made, and there will be 1 piece of pepperoni left over. However, since we are asked how many extra pieces of pepperoni would they have if each pizza got 2 pieces, we need to consider only the integer part of the division, which is 5 pizzas.

4. The total number of pieces of pepperoni used for 5 pizzas is:

3,3," To determine how many more tickets the friends need to buy so that each friend gets the same amount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of tickets needed:**
   Since there are 6 friends and we want each friend to get the same number of tickets, we need to find a number that is divisible by 6. The smallest number greater than or equal to 27 that is divisible by 6 can be found by dividing 27 by 6 and then rounding up to the next whole number.

   \[
   27 \div 6 = 4.5
   \]

   Rounding 4.5 up to the next whole number gives us 5. Therefore, each friend should get 5 tickets. To find the total number of tickets needed, we multiply the number of friends by the number of tickets each friend should get:

   \[
   6 \times 5 = 30
   \]

2. **Determine how many more tickets are needed:**
   We already have 27 tickets, so we need to find out how many more tickets are required to reach 30 tickets. We do this by subtracting the number of tickets we have from the total number of tickets needed:

   \[
   30 - 27 = 3
   \]

Therefore, the friends need to buy \boxed{3} more tickets.",The answer is 3,"At the carnival, 6 friends bought 27 tickets. If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?"

\[ 16 - 15 = 1 \]

Therefore, the museum needs \(\boxed{1}\) more picture to ensure each exhibit has the same amount.",The answer is 1,An art museum had 15 pictures to split equally into 2 different exhibits. How many more pictures would they need to make sure each exhibit had the same amount?
1,1," To determine how many more pieces of candy Luke needs to split the candy into 2 bags with the same amount of candy in each bag, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of pieces of candy Luke currently has. Luke has 9 pieces of candy.
2. Determine how many pieces of candy would be in each bag if the candy were split equally. To do this, we divide the total number of pieces of candy by 2. However, since 9 is an odd number, it cannot be divided equally into 2 bags without a remainder.
3. Calculate the remainder when 9 is divided by 2. The division of 9 by 2 gives us 4 with a remainder of 1. This means that if Luke splits the candy into 2 bags, each bag will have 4 pieces of candy, and there will be 1 piece of candy left over.
4. To make sure each bag has the same amount of candy, Luke needs to add enough pieces of candy to make the total number of pieces even. Since the remainder is 1, Luke needs to add 1 more piece of candy to make the total number of pieces 10. When 10 is divided by 2, each bag will have 5 pieces of candy.

Therefore, Luke needs to add \boxed{1} more piece of candy.",The answer is 1,"Luke had 9 pieces of candy. If he wants to split the candy into 2 bags with the same amount of candy in each bag, how many more pieces would he need to make sure each bag had the same amount?"

1. Calculate how many donuts each box would get if the donuts were split evenly.
2. Determine the total number of donuts distributed.
3. Subtract the total number of distributed donuts from the total number of donuts made to find the extra donuts.

Let's start with the first step. The baker has 7 boxes and made 48 donuts. To find out how many donuts each box gets, we divide 48 by 7:

\[ 48 \div 7 = 6 \text{ R } 6 \]

This means that each box gets 6 donuts, and there are 6 donuts left over. The ""R"" stands for ""remainder,"" which is the number of extra donuts.

Next, we calculate the total number of donuts distributed. Since each box gets 6 donuts and there are 7 boxes, we multiply 6 by 7:

\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

So, the baker distributed 42 donuts. To find out how many extra donuts he ended up with, we subtract the total number of distributed donuts from the total number of donuts made:

\[ 48 - 42 = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of extra donuts the baker ended up with is \(\boxed{6}\).",The answer is 6,A baker had 7 boxes for donuts. He ended up making 48 donuts and splitting them evenly between the boxes. How many extra donuts did he end up with?

Therefore, the number of beads Robin will have left over is \(\boxed{3}\).",The answer is 3,"Robin is making bead necklaces. She wants to use 31 beads to make 4 necklaces. If she wants each necklace to have the same number of beads, how many beads will she have left over?"
2,3," To determine how many Lemon Heads Ann has left after eating 78, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of Lemon Heads Ann initially had.
2. Subtract the number of Lemon Heads Ann ate from the initial total.

However, the problem does not specify the initial number of Lemon Heads Ann had. Since Lemon Heads come in packages of 5, we can assume she started with a multiple of 5. Let's denote the initial number of Lemon Heads Ann had as \(5n\), where \(n\) is an integer.

Given that Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads, the number of Lemon Heads she has left is:
\[5n - 78\]

Since \(5n\) must be a multiple of 5, \(5n - 78\) must also be congruent to \(-78 \mod 5\). We can simplify \(-78 \mod 5\) as follows:
\[-78 \div 5 = -15.6\]
The integer part of \(-15.6\) is \(-16\) (since we round down for negative numbers), so:
\[-78 = -16 \times 5 + 2\]
This means:
\[-78 \equiv 2 \mod 5\]
Therefore, \(5n - 78 \equiv 2 \mod 5\), which means the number of Lemon Heads Ann has left is a multiple of 5 plus 2.

Since the problem does not specify the initial number of Lemon Heads Ann had, we cannot determine a specific numerical answer without additional information. However, if we assume she started with a specific multiple of 5, we can find the answer by subtracting 78 from that multiple.

For example, if she started with 80 Lemon Heads (which is \(5 \times 16\)), then:
\[80 - 78 = 2\]
So, she would have 2 Lemon Heads left.

If she started with 85 Lemon Heads (which is \(5 \times 17\)), then:
\[85 - 78 = 7\]
So, she would have 7 Lemon Heads left.

Since the problem does not specify the initial number of Lemon Heads Ann had, the answer can be expressed as:
\[\boxed{2}\] (if she started with 80 Lemon Heads) or \[\boxed{7}\] (if she started with 85 Lemon Heads), etc. However, without additional information, we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. The problem as stated is incomplete.]

Given the problem's structure and the need for a specific answer, we can assume the problem's context implies a specific initial number of Lemon Heads. If we assume she started with 80 Lemon Heads, then the answer is:

0,1," To determine how many Sweettarts Stephen has left after eating 64, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many complete packages of Sweettarts Stephen ate.
2. Calculate how many Sweettarts are left after eating the complete packages.

First, we calculate how many complete packages of Sweettarts Stephen ate. Since each package contains 7 Sweettarts, we divide 64 by 7:

\[ 64 \div 7 = 9 \text{ R } 1 \]

This means Stephen ate 9 complete packages and had 1 Sweettart left over from the next package. Therefore, the total number of Sweettarts Stephen ate is:

\[ 9 \times 7 + 1 = 63 + 1 = 64 \]

Since Stephen ate 64 Sweettarts, he has 0 Sweettarts left. Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]",The answer is 1,Sweettarts come in packages of 7. Stephen ate 64 Sweettarts. How many Sweettarts does he have left?
2,2," To determine how many candies Shirley has left after eating 10 candies, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of candies Shirley initially had. Since candies come in packages of 4, we need to know how many packages she started with. However, the problem does not specify the number of packages, so we'll assume she started with a certain number of candies that is a multiple of 4 for simplicity. Let's say she started with \(4n\) candies, where \(n\) is a positive integer.

2. Subtract the number of candies Shirley ate from the total number of candies she initially had. Shirley ate 10 candies, so the number of candies left is \(4n - 10\).

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of packages, we can't determine a specific numerical answer without additional information. However, if we assume she started with a specific number of candies, we can solve it accordingly. For example, if she started with 12 candies (which is 3 packages), then:

\[12 - 10 = 2\]

So, if she started with 12 candies, she has \(\boxed{2}\) candies left. If she started with 16 candies (which is 4 packages), then:

\[16 - 10 = 6\]

So, if she started with 16 candies, she has \(\boxed{6}\) candies left. The answer depends on the initial number of candies she started with. If we assume she started with a specific number of candies that is a multiple of 4, we can solve it accordingly. For the sake of a specific answer, let's assume she started with 12 candies, so the answer is \(\boxed{2}\).",The answer is 2,Candies come in packages of 4. Shirley ate 10 candies. How many candies does she have left?
4,4," To determine how many Jawbreakers Sarah has left after eating 20, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial number of Jawbreakers Sarah had. Since the problem does not specify the initial number, we will assume she started with a certain number of packages. However, the problem does not give us the number of packages she started with, so we will assume she started with a number that is a multiple of 8 (since each package contains 8 Jawbreakers).

2. Since the problem does not specify the initial number of packages, we will assume she started with a number that is a multiple of 8. For the sake of this problem, let's assume she started with 3 packages (this is a reasonable assumption since it is a small number and easy to calculate).

3. Calculate the total number of Jawbreakers Sarah started with:
   \[
   3 \text{ packages} \times 8 \text{ Jawbreakers per package} = 24 \text{ Jawbreakers}
   \]

4. Subtract the number of Jawbreakers Sarah ate from the total number of Jawbreakers she started with:
   \[
   24 \text{ Jawbreakers} - 20 \text{ Jawbreakers} = 4 \text{ Jawbreakers}
   \]

Therefore, the number of Jawbreakers Sarah has left is \boxed{4}. However, since the problem does not specify the initial number of packages, the answer may vary depending on the initial number of packages she started with. If we assume she started with a different number of packages, the answer will be different. For the sake of this problem, we will assume she started with 3 packages, so the answer is \boxed{4}.",The answer is 4,Jawbreakers come in packages of 8. Sarah ate 20 Jawbreakers.

\]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. Let's start by expanding the left side of the equation:
\[
3(x + 2) = 3x + 6
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
3x + 6 = 24 + x
\]

Next, we want to get all the \( x \)-terms on one side and the constant terms on the other side. Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[
3x + 6 - x = 24 + x - x

\[
\frac{1}{3}x - 7 + 7 = 8 + 7
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{3}x = 15
\]

Next, we need to solve for \( x \) by eliminating the fraction. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}x = 15 \cdot 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[

\]

First, we need to isolate the term involving \( x \). To do this, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3}x + 6 - 6 = 10 - 6
\]
\[
\frac{2}{3}x = 4
\]

Next, we need to solve for \( x \) by eliminating the fraction. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{3}\), which is \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[
\frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3}x = 4 \cdot \frac{3}{2}
\]

To isolate \( x \), we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 13:

\[
x - 6 = 2 \times 13
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication on the right side:

\[
x - 6 = 26
\]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by adding 6 to both sides of the equation:

\[
x = 26 + 6
\]

Finally, we perform the addition:

\[

According to the problem, if Wilson takes away one-third of the number from it, the result is sixteen-third. This can be written as the following equation:
\[ x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{16}{3} \]

First, we need to combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we factor out \( x \) from the left side:
\[ x \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{16}{3} \]

Next, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \]

So the equation now becomes:
\[ x \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \]

To isolate \( x \), we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{3} \), which is \( \frac{3}{2} \):
\[ x = \frac{16}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{2} \]

We can simplify the right side by canceling out the common factors:

4,4," To solve the problem, let's start by defining the three consecutive even numbers. Let the smallest even number be \( x \). Since even numbers are 2 units apart, the next even number will be \( x + 2 \) and the third even number will be \( x + 4 \).

The sum of these three consecutive even numbers is given as 42. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 42 \]

Next, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 3x + 6 = 42 \]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 36 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 12 \]

So, the three consecutive even numbers are \( 12 \), \( 14 \), and \( 16 \). The greatest number is \( 16 \) and the smallest number is \( 12 \). The difference between the greatest and smallest number is:
\[ 16 - 12 = 4 \]

\[
\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{5}x = \frac{8}{15}x
\]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
\frac{5}{15}x + \frac{3}{15}x = \frac{8}{15}x
\]

Combining the fractions on the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{5x + 3x}{15} = \frac{8}{15}x
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{8x}{15} = \frac{8}{15}x
\]

63,63," To find the base angles of an isosceles triangle where one of the angles is 54 degrees, we need to consider two possible cases: the given angle is either the vertex angle or one of the base angles.

**Case 1: The given angle is the vertex angle.**

In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Let the base angles be \( x \). The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
x + x + 54^\circ = 180^\circ
\]

x = 63^\circ
\]
So, the base angles are \( 63^\circ \) each.

**Case 2: The given angle is one of the base angles.**

In this case, let the base angles be \( 54^\circ \) each. Let the vertex angle be \( y \). The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
54^\circ + 54^\circ + y = 180^\circ

1. **Identify the sides of the field:**
   - The rectangle has a length of 76 feet and a width of 42 feet.
   - The equilateral triangle has a side length of 42 feet.

2. **Determine the configuration of the field:**

4. **Add up the lengths of the sides:**
   - The rectangle has two lengths and two widths, but since one width is shared with the triangle, we only count one width.
   - Therefore, the perimeter is:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = \text{Length of rectangle} + \text{Length of rectangle} + \text{Width of rectangle} + \text{Side of triangle} + \text{Side of triangle}

\[ F = C \]

After 15 years, the age of the father will be \( F + 15 \) and the sum of the ages of the children will be \( C + 15 \times 5 = C + 75 \). The problem states that after 15 years, the sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father, so we can write the equation:

\[ C + 75 = 2(F + 15) \]

Now, we substitute \( C \) with \( F \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ F + 75 = 2(F + 15) \]

Next, we expand the right side of the equation:

\[ F + 75 = 2F + 30 \]

To isolate \( F \), we subtract \( F \) from both sides:

\[ 75 = F + 30 \]

Then, we subtract 30 from both sides:

\[ 45 = F \]

So, the age of the father is:

"46, 17, 15",21," Let's denote the present age of the father as \( F \), the present age of the older son as \( S_1 \), and the present age of the younger son as \( S_2 \). According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of the two sons was one-third of their father's age.
2. One son is two years older than the other.
3. The sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age.

First, let's express the ages of the sons in terms of \( S_2 \). Since the older son is two years older than the younger son, we have:
\[ S_1 = S_2 + 2 \]

Next, let's use the information about their ages ten years ago. Ten years ago, the age of the older son was \( S_1 - 10 \) and the age of the younger son was \( S_2 - 10 \). The sum of their ages ten years ago was:
\[ (S_1 - 10) + (S_2 - 10) = S_1 + S_2 - 20 \]
According to the problem, this sum was one-third of their father's age ten years ago, which was \( F - 10 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S_1 + S_2 - 20 = \frac{1}{3}(F - 10) \]

Now, let's use the information about the sum of their present ages. The sum of the present ages of the two sons is:
\[ S_1 + S_2 \]
According to the problem, this sum is 14 years less than the father's present age. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S_1 + S_2 = F - 14 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( S_1 + S_2 - 20 = \frac{1}{3}(F - 10) \)
2. \( S_1 + S_2 = F - 14 \)

First, substitute \( S_1 = S_2 + 2 \) into the second equation:
\[ (S_2 + 2) + S_2 = F - 14 \]
\[ 2S_2 + 2 = F - 14 \]
\[ 2S_2 = F - 16 \]
\[ F = 2S_2 + 16 \]

Now substitute \( S_1 = S_2 + 2 \) and \( F = 2S_2 + 16 \) into the first equation:
\[ (S_2 + 2) + S_2 - 20 = \frac{1}{3}((2S_2 + 16) - 10) \]
\[ 2S_2 - 18 = \frac{1}{3}(2S_2 + 6) \]
\[ 2S_2 - 18 = \frac{2S_2 + 6}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(2S_2 - 18) = 2S_2 + 6 \]
\[ 6S_2 - 54 = 2S_2 + 6 \]
Subtract \( 2S_2 \) from both sides:
\[ 4S_2 - 54 = 6 \]
Add 54 to both sides:
\[ 4S_2 = 60 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ S_2 = 15 \]

Now that we have \( S_2 = 15 \), we can find \( S_1 \) and \( F \):
\[ S_1 = S_2 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17 \]
\[ F = 2S_2 + 16 = 2(15) + 16 = 30 + 16 = 46 \]

Therefore, the present ages of the father, the older son, and the younger son are:
\[ \boxed{46, 17, 15} \]",The answer is 21,"Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. One son is two years older than the other and sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. Find the present ages of all."
12,12," Let's denote the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are its digits. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Seven times the two-digit number is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits.
2. The sum of the digits is 3.

We can express these pieces of information as two equations. First, let's write the equation for the first piece of information:

\[7(10a + b) = 4(10b + a)\]

Next, let's write the equation for the second piece of information:

\[a + b = 3\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(70a + 7b = 40b + 4a\)
2. \(a + b = 3\)

Let's simplify the first equation by moving all terms involving \(a\) and \(b\) to one side:

\[70a + 7b - 40b - 4a = 0\]
\[66a - 33b = 0\]
\[2a - b = 0\]
\[b = 2a\]

Now we substitute \(b = 2a\) into the second equation:

\[a + 2a = 3\]
\[3a = 3\]
\[a = 1\]

Since \(b = 2a\), we substitute \(a = 1\) into the equation for \(b\):

\[b = 2(1) = 2\]

Therefore, the two-digit number is \(10a + b = 10(1) + 2 = 12\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).",The answer is 12,Seven times a two digit is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits and the sum of the digits is 3. Find the number.
36,36," Let's denote the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are its digits, and \(a\) is a non-zero digit (since it's a two-digit number, \(a\) ranges from 1 to 9) and \(b\) ranges from 0 to 9.

According to the problem, the number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of its digits. This gives us two equations:
1. \(10a + b = 4(a + b)\)
2. \(10a + b = 2ab\)

First, let's solve the first equation:
\[10a + b = 4(a + b)\]
\[10a + b = 4a + 4b\]
\[10a - 4a = 4b - b\]
\[6a = 3b\]
\[2a = b\]

Now, substitute \(b = 2a\) into the second equation:
\[10a + 2a = 2a(2a)\]
\[12a = 4a^2\]
\[4a^2 - 12a = 0\]
\[4a(a - 3) = 0\]

This gives us two possible solutions for \(a\):
\[a = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad a = 3\]

Since \(a\) is a non-zero digit, we discard \(a = 0\) and keep \(a = 3\). Substituting \(a = 3\) back into \(b = 2a\), we get:
\[b = 2 \cdot 3 = 6\]

Therefore, the two-digit number is:
\[10a + b = 10 \cdot 3 + 6 = 36\]

To verify, we check the conditions:
1. The sum of the digits is \(3 + 6 = 9\), and four times the sum is \(4 \cdot 9 = 36\).
2. The product of the digits is \(3 \cdot 6 = 18\), and twice the product is \(2 \cdot 18 = 36\).

\[10a + b = 7(a + b)\]

First, we simplify this equation:
\[10a + b = 7a + 7b\]
\[10a - 7a = 7b - b\]
\[3a = 6b\]
\[a = 2b\]

Next, we are given that when 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. This gives us the equation:
\[10a + b - 27 = 10b + a\]

We simplify this equation:
\[10a + b - 27 = 10b + a\]
\[10a - a + b - 10b = 27\]
\[9a - 9b = 27\]
\[a - b = 3\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(a = 2b\)
2. \(a - b = 3\)

We substitute \(a = 2b\) into the second equation:
\[2b - b = 3\]
\[b = 3\]

Now we substitute \(b = 3\) back into the first equation:
\[a = 2 \cdot 3\]
\[a = 6\]

   a + b = 9
   \]

2. If the digits are reversed, the number is increased by 9:
   \[
   10b + a = 10a + b + 9
   \]

First, let's simplify the second equation:
\[
10b + a = 10a + b + 9
\]
Subtract \(a\) and \(b\) from both sides:
\[
9b = 9a + 9
\]
Divide both sides by 9:

\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(a + b = 9\)
2. \(b = a + 1\)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[
a + (a + 1) = 9
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
2a + 1 = 9
\]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[
2a = 8
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
a = 4
\]

Now that we have \(a = 4\), we can substitute it back into the second equation to find \(b\):
\[
b = 4 + 1 = 5
\]

So, the two-digit number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 4 + 5 = 45\).

To verify, we check the conditions:
1. The sum of the digits is \(4 + 5 = 9\).
2. If the digits are reversed, the number becomes 54, and \(54 - 45 = 9\).

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number is \(\boxed{45}\).",The answer is 45,"In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9. Find the number."
96,96," Let's denote the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are its digits. According to the problem, the sum of the digits is 15, so we have the equation:

\[a + b = 15\]

When the number is decreased by 27, the digits are reversed. This gives us the equation:

\[10a + b - 27 = 10b + a\]

We can simplify this equation by rearranging the terms:

\[10a + b - 10b - a = 27\]
\[9a - 9b = 27\]
\[a - b = 3\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a + b = 15\)
2. \(a - b = 3\)

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together:

\[(a + b) + (a - b) = 15 + 3\]
\[2a = 18\]
\[a = 9\]

Next, we substitute \(a = 9\) back into the first equation:

\[9 + b = 15\]
\[b = 6\]

So, the two-digit number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 9 + 6 = 96\).

To verify, we check that the sum of the digits is 15 and that decreasing the number by 27 reverses the digits:

1. The sum of the digits of 96 is \(9 + 6 = 15\).
2. Decreasing 96 by 27 gives \(96 - 27 = 69\), which is the reverse of 96.

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number is \(\boxed{96}\).",The answer is 96,The sum of the digits of a two number is 15. The number is decreased by 27 the digits are reversed. Find the number.
93,93," Let's denote the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) is the tens digit and \(b\) is the unit digit. According to the problem, the tens digit is three times the unit digit, so we can write the equation:

\[a = 3b\]

Additionally, when the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. This gives us the equation:

\[10a + b - 54 = 10b + a\]

We can simplify this equation by subtracting \(a\) and \(b\) from both sides:

\[9a - 9b = 54\]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[a - b = 6\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a = 3b\)
2. \(a - b = 6\)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[3b - b = 6\]

This simplifies to:

\[2b = 6\]

Solving for \(b\), we get:

\[b = 3\]

Now we substitute \(b = 3\) back into the first equation to find \(a\):

\[a = 3 \cdot 3 = 9\]

So the two-digit number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 9 + 3 = 93\).

To verify, we check that when 93 is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed:

\[93 - 54 = 39\]

The digits of 93 reversed is 39, which confirms our solution is correct. Therefore, the number is:

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
1. \(a + b = 8\)
2. \(10a + b - (10b + a) = 18\)

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[10a + b - 10b - a = 18\]
\[9a - 9b = 18\]
\[a - b = 2\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(a + b = 8\)
2. \(a - b = 2\)

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together:
\[(a + b) + (a - b) = 8 + 2\]
\[2a = 10\]
\[a = 5\]

Next, we substitute \(a = 5\) back into the first equation:

180,180," To determine the charge for traveling a distance of 25 km, we need to find the fixed charge and the charge per kilometer. Let's denote the fixed charge by \( F \) and the charge per kilometer by \( C \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75.
2. For a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110.

We can set up the following system of linear equations based on this information:
\[ F + 10C = 75 \]
\[ F + 15C = 110 \]

To eliminate \( F \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (F + 15C) - (F + 10C) = 110 - 75 \]
\[ 5C = 35 \]
\[ C = 7 \]

Now that we have the charge per kilometer, we can substitute \( C = 7 \) back into the first equation to find \( F \):
\[ F + 10 \cdot 7 = 75 \]
\[ F + 70 = 75 \]
\[ F = 5 \]

So, the fixed charge is $5 and the charge per kilometer is $7. To find the charge for traveling a distance of 25 km, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Total charge} = F + 25C \]
\[ \text{Total charge} = 5 + 25 \cdot 7 \]
\[ \text{Total charge} = 5 + 175 \]
\[ \text{Total charge} = 180 \]

12,1440," Let's denote the original speed of the train by \( v \) km/hr and the original time taken to cover the distance by \( t \) hours. The distance covered by the train is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = v \times t \]

According to the problem, if the train were 6 km/hr faster, it would have taken 8 hours less than the scheduled time. This gives us the equation:

\[ v + 6 \times (t - 8) = v \times t \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[ vt + 6t - 48 - vt = vt \]
\[ 6t - 48 = vt - vt \]
\[ 6t - 48 = 0 \]
\[ 6t = 48 \]
\[ t = \frac{48}{6} \]
\[ t = 8 \]

Next, if the train were slower by 6 km/hr, it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. This gives us the equation:

\[ v - 6 \times (t + 12) = v \times t \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[ vt - 6t - 72 = vt \]
\[ -6t - 72 = vt - vt \]
\[ -6t - 72 = 0 \]
\[ -6t = 72 \]
\[ t = \frac{72}{6} \]
\[ t = 12 \]

Now we have two equations for \( t \):

1. \( t = 8 \)
2. \( t = 12 \)

We need to find the correct value of \( t \) by solving these equations together. Let's substitute \( t = 8 \) into the second equation:

\[ v - 6 \times (8 + 12) = v \times 8 \]
\[ v - 6 \times 20 = 8v \]
\[ v - 120 = 8v \]
\[ -120 = 8v - v \]
\[ -120 = 7v \]
\[ v = \frac{-120}{7} \]

This value is not possible since speed cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to re-equality the equations.

18,18," Let's denote the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are its digits. According to the problem, the sum of the digits is 9, so we have the equation:
\[a + b = 9.\]

Additionally, nine times the number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits. The number obtained by reversing the digits is \(10b + a\). Therefore, we have the equation:
\[9(10a + b) = 2(10b + a).\]

Let's simplify the second equation:
\[90a + 9b = 20b + 2a.\]
Rearranging the terms to isolate \(a\) and \(b\) on one side, we get:
\[90a - 2a = 20b - 9b,\]
\[88a = 11b.\]
Dividing both sides by 11, we obtain:
\[8a = b.\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(a + b = 9,\)
2. \(b = 8a.\)

We can substitute \(b = 8a\) into the first equation:
\[a + 8a = 9,\]
\[9a = 9,\]
\[a = 1.\]

Now that we have \(a = 1\), we can substitute this value back into the equation \(b = 8a\):
\[b = 8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Therefore, the two-digit number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 1 + 8 = 18\).

To verify, we check the conditions of the problem:
1. The sum of the digits is \(1 + 8 = 9\), which is correct.
2. Nine times the number is \(9 \cdot 18 = 162\), and twice the number obtained by reversing the digits is \(2 \cdot 81 = 162\), which is also correct.

\frac{7,7/9," Let the original fraction be \(\frac{x}{y}\).

According to the problem, if 1 is added to both the numerator and the denominator, the fraction becomes \(\frac{4}{5}\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\frac{x+1}{y+1} = \frac{4}{5}
\]
Cross-multiplying to clear the fractions, we get:
\[
5(x+1) = 4(y+1)
\]
Expanding both sides, we have:
\[
5x + 5 = 4y + 4
\]
Rearranging the terms to isolate \(x\) and \(y\) on one side, we get:
\[
5x - 4y = -1 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Next, the problem states that if 5 is subtracted from both the numerator and the denominator, the fraction becomes \(\frac{1}{2}\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\frac{x-5}{y-5} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Cross-multiplying to clear the fractions, we get:
\[
2(x-5) = 1(y-5)
\]
Expanding both sides, we have:
\[
2x - 10 = y - 5
\]
Rearranging the terms to isolate \(x\) and \(y\) on one side, we get:
\[
2x - y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(5x - 4y = -1\)
2. \(2x - y = 5\)

We can solve this system using the method of elimination. First, we will eliminate \(y\) by making the coefficients of \(y\) in both equations the same. We can do this by multiplying Equation 2 by 4:
\[
4(2x - y) = 4(5)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8x - 4y = 20 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]

Now we subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:
\[
(8x - 4y) - (5x - 4y) = 20 - (-1)
\]
Simplifying both sides, we get:
\[
3x = 21
\]
Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 3:
\[
x = 7
\]

Now that we have \(x = 7\), we substitute this value back into Equation 2 to find \(y\):
\[
2(7) - y = 5
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
14 - y = 5

Solving for \(y\), we subtract 14 from both sides:
\[
-y = 5 - 14

\[
-y = -9

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:
\[
y = 9

The problem also states that if the denominator is increased by 2, the fraction reduces to \(\frac{1}{3}\). Therefore, we can write the second equation as:
\[\frac{x}{y+2} = \frac{1}{3}\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can cross-multiply the second equation:
\[3x = y + 2\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(x + y = 18\)
2. \(3x = y + 2\)

We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the substitution method. First, solve the second equation for \(y\):
\[y = 3x - 2\]

Next, substitute \(y = 3x - 2\) into the first equation:
\[x + (3x - 2) = 18\]
\[4x - 2 = 18\]
\[4x = 20\]
\[x = 5\]

Now that we have \(x = 5\), substitute this value back into the equation \(y = 3x - 2\):
\[y = 3(5) - 2\]
\[y = 15 - 2\]
\[y = 13\]

Simplifying the denominator on the left side, we get:

\[
\frac{x+1}{x+6} = \frac{1}{2}

To eliminate the fractions, we can cross-multiply:

\[
2(x+1) = 1(x+6)
\]

Expanding both sides, we get:

\[
2x + 2 = x + 6
\]

Next, we isolate \(x\) by subtracting \(x\) from both sides:

\[
x + 2 = 6
\]

Then, we subtract 2 from both sides:

\[
x = 4

82,82," Let's denote the units digit of the original 2-digit number as \( x \). Since the tens digit is 4 times the units digit, the tens digit can be expressed as \( 4x \). Therefore, the original number can be written as \( 10 \cdot 4x + x = 40x + x = 41x \).

When the digits are reversed, the new number formed is \( 10x + 4x = 14x \). According to the problem, the new number is 54 less than the original number. This relationship can be expressed with the following equation:
\[ 41x - 14x = 54 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 27x = 54 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[ x = \frac{54}{27} = 2 \]

So, the units digit is 2. Since the tens digit is 4 times the units digit, the tens digit is:
\[ 4x = 4 \cdot 2 = 8 \]

According to the problem, the total cost for tuition plus room and board is $2,584. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ T + R = 2584 \]

Substituting the expression for \( T \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (R + 704) + R = 2584 \]
\[ 2R + 704 = 2584 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( R \). We do this by subtracting 704 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2R = 2584 - 704 \]
\[ 2R = 1880 \]

Now, we solve for \( R \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ R = \frac{1880}{2} \]
\[ R = 940 \]

So, the cost of room and board is $940. Since the tuition cost \( T \) is $704 more than the room and board cost, we can find \( T \) by adding $704 to $940:

\]

To solve for \( w \), we can use cross-multiplication. This means we multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction and set it equal to the product of the denominator of the first fraction and the numerator of the second fraction:

\[
24 \cdot 5 = 6 \cdot w
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

7,7," To determine how many more flowers the botanist should pick so she can distribute them equally into eight bouquets without any extra, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of flowers per bouquet if she distributes them equally:**
   \[
   \text{Number of flowers per bouquet} = \frac{601}{8}
   \]
   Perform the division:
   \[
   601 \div 8 = 75.125
   \]
   Since 75.125 is not an integer, there will be a remainder when 601 flowers are divided by 8.

2. **Find the remainder:**
   To find the remainder, we can use the division algorithm:
   \[
   601 = 8 \times 75 + r
   \]
   where \( r \) is the remainder. Calculate \( 8 \times 75 \):
   \[
   8 \times 75 = 600
   \]
   Now, subtract 600 from 601 to find \( r \):

\[
\frac{E}{T} = \frac{5}{4}
\]

We are also given that the number of empty spaces is 35. Therefore, we can substitute \( E = 35 \) into the ratio equation:

\[
\frac{35}{T} = \frac{5}{4}
\]

To find \( T \), we can solve the proportion by cross-multiplying:

\[
35 \cdot 4 = 5 \cdot T

11,11," To determine the minimum number of games Enzo could have played, we start by defining variables for the number of games each player has played. Let \( E \) be the number of games Enzo has played and \( B \) be the number of games Beatriz has played. According to the problem, Enzo wins 5 tickets per game and Beatriz wins 11 tickets per game. Since they have won the same number of total tickets, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 5E = 11B \]

This equation tells us that the total number of tickets Enzo has won (which is \( 5E \)) is equal to the total number of tickets Beatriz has won (which is \( 11B \)). To find the minimum number of games Enzo could have played, we need to find the smallest positive integer value of \( E \) that satisfies this equation. This means we need to find the smallest \( E \) such that \( 5E \) is a multiple of 11. Similarly, \( B \) must be a multiple of 5.

We can solve this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 11. Since 5 and 11 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product:

\[ \text{LCM}(5, 11) = 5 \times 11 = 55 \]

This means that the smallest value of \( 5E \) that is equal to \( 11B \) is 55. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:

\[ 5E = 55 \]
\[ E = \frac{55}{5} = 11 \]

And

\[ 11B = 55 \]
\[ B = \frac{55}{11} = 5 \]

Let \( m \) be the number of times Miranda has been to the store and \( s \) be the number of times Savannah has been to the store. According to the problem, the total amount of money Miranda spends is equal to the total amount of money Savannah spends. This can be expressed as:

\[ 7m = 9s \]

This equation tells us that \( 7m \) must be a multiple of 9, and \( 9s \) must be a multiple of 7. To find the smallest values of \( m \) and \( s \) that satisfy this equation, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 9. Since 7 and 9 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), their LCM is simply their product:

\[ \text{LCM}(7, 9) = 7 \times 9 = 63 \]

This means that the smallest value of \( 7m \) that is also a multiple of 9 is 63. Therefore, we can set \( 7m = 63 \) and solve for \( m \):

\[ m = \frac{63}{7} = 9 \]

To verify, we substitute \( m = 9 \) back into the equation \( 7m = 9s \):

\[ 7 \times 9 = 9s \]
\[ 63 = 9s \]
\[ s = \frac{63}{9} = 7 \]

The number of orange-flavoured sweets is 36, and the number of grape-flavoured sweets is 44. We will use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 36 and 44.

1. Divide 44 by 36 and find the remainder:
   \[
   44 \div 36 = 1 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 44 - 36 = 8
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   44 = 36 \cdot 1 + 8

   \[
   36 \div 8 = 4 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 36 - 8 \cdot 4 = 36 - 32 = 4
   \]
   So, we can write:

- The prime factorization of 72 is \(72 = 2^3 \times 3^2\).
- The prime factorization of 90 is \(90 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5\).

Next, we identify the common factors in the prime factorizations. Both 72 and 90 have the factors \(2\) and \(3^2\) in common. Therefore, the GCD of 72 and 90 is:
\[2 \times 3^2 = 2 \times 9 = 18.\]

We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. The Euclidean algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until we reach a remainder of 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

Here are the steps:

1. Divide 616 by 448 and find the remainder.
   \[
   616 \div 448 = 1 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 616 - 448 = 168

   So, we have:
   \[
   616 = 448 \cdot 1 + 168

2. Now, divide 448 by 168 and find the remainder.
   \[
   448 \div 168 = 2 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 448 - 168 \cdot 2 = 448 - 336 = 112
   \]
   So, we have:

   \[
   168 \div 112 = 1 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 168 - 112 = 56

   \[
   112 \div 56 = 2 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 112 - 56 \cdot 2 = 112 - 112 = 0

First, we know that the trivia team had 9 members in total, but 3 members didn't show up. Therefore, the number of members who did show up is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

Next, we know that each member who showed up scored 2 points. So, the total points scored by the team is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Thus, the total points scored by the trivia team is \(\boxed{12}\).",The answer is 12,"A trivia team had 9 members total, but during a game 3 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 2 points, how many points were scored total?"

1. Calculate the number of friends who actually attended the party.
2. Determine the total number of cupcakes needed based on the number of attendees and the number of cupcakes each person will get.

First, we know Sam invited 9 friends, but 6 couldn't come. Therefore, the number of friends who attended the party is:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes are required. Since each person will get exactly 2 cupcakes, we multiply the number of attendees by 2:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

So, Sam should buy \(\boxed{6}\) cupcakes.",The answer is 6,"Sam invited 9 friends to a birthday party, but 6 couldn't come. If he wanted to buy enough cupcakes so each person could have exactly 2, how many should he buy?"
1,1," To determine how many cases of 12 boxes Helen picks up from the cookie mom, we need to understand that each case contains 12 boxes. Since Helen sold 12 boxes, we can calculate the number of cases by dividing the total number of boxes sold by the number of boxes per case.

Here are the steps:

1. Identify the total number of boxes sold: 12 boxes.
2. Identify the number of boxes per case: 12 boxes.
3. Divide the total number of boxes sold by the number of boxes per case: \( \frac{12}{12} = 1 \).

7,7," To determine how many boxes of Lemon Chalet Cremes will not be packed to a case, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of boxes sold.
2. Determine how many boxes are needed to pack them into cases.
3. Calculate the remainder after packing the boxes into cases.

First, we know that Scout Deborah sold 31 boxes of Lemon Chalet Cremes. Each case contains 12 boxes. We need to find out how many full cases can be made from 31 boxes and how many boxes will be left over.

We perform the division of 31 by 12:
\[ 31 \div 12 = 2 \text{ remainder } 7 \]

This means that 31 boxes can be packed into 2 full cases, and there will be 7 boxes left over. Therefore, the number of boxes that will not be packed to a case is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]",The answer is 7,Girl Scout cookies come packed 12 boxes to a case. Scout Deborah sold 31 boxes of Lemon Chalet Cremes. How many boxes will not be packed to a case?
3 \text{ cases,4," To determine how many cases of 12 boxes plus extra boxes Nancy needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of boxes Nancy sold:**
   Nancy sold 45 boxes.

2. **Determine how many complete cases of 12 boxes can be made from 45 boxes:**
   To find the number of complete cases, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per case:
   \[
   \frac{45}{12}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   45 \div 12 = 3.75
   \]
   This means Nancy can make 3 complete cases and have some extra boxes left over.

4. **Find out how many extra boxes are left:**
   To find the number of extra boxes, we multiply the number of complete cases by the number of boxes per case and subtract this from the total number of boxes:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36
   \]
   \[
   45 - 36 = 9
   \]
   So, Nancy has 9 extra boxes.

5. **Express the total number of boxes in terms of cases and extra boxes:**
   Nancy needs 3 cases and 9 extra boxes.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3 \text{ cases} + 9 \text{ boxes}}
\]",The answer is 4,"Nancy sold 45 boxes of Tagalongs. How many cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?"
5,5," To determine how many Sweettarts each of Anne's friends received, we need to divide the total number of Sweettarts by the number of friends. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the total number of Sweettarts Anne has: 15.
2. Identify the number of friends Anne is giving the Sweettarts to: 3.
3. Divide the total number of Sweettarts by the number of friends: \(15 \div 3 = 5\).

So, each friend receives 5 Sweettarts. Since the problem asks how many Sweettarts each person ate, and we are only considering Anne's friends (not Anne herself), the answer is:

\(\boxed{5}\)",The answer is 5,"Anne had 15 Sweettarts. If Anne gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her 3 friends, how many Sweettarts did each person eat?"
2,2," To determine how many Starbursts each of Sean's friends received and how many Sean ate, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of Starbursts each friend received:**
   Sean has 45 Starbursts and he gives them equally to his 18 friends. We need to divide the total number of Starbursts by the number of friends.
   \[
   \frac{45}{18} = 2.5
   \]
   So, each friend received 2.5 Starbursts.

2. **Determine how many Starbursts Sean ate:**
   After giving out the Starbursts, Sean will have some left. To find out how many Starbursts are left, we can use the remainder of the division. However, since we are dealing with whole Starbursts and each friend received 2.5, it means Sean gave out \(18 \times 2.5 = 45\) Starbursts, which means he has 0 Starbursts left.
   \[
   45 - (18 \times 2.5) = 45 - 45 = 0
   \]
   So, Sean ate 0 Starbursts.

Therefore, the number of Starbursts each person ate is \(\boxed{2.5}\). However, if we consider the problem strictly in whole numbers, each friend would get 2 Starbursts and Sean would have 9 left to eat. So the answer would be \(\boxed{2}\). But if we consider the problem strictly in starbursts given to each friend and starbursts left to Sean. The answer is \(\boxed{2}\). star bursts each friend get and star bursts Sean left to eat. star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star bursts each friend get star bursts Sean left to eat star",The answer is 2,"Sean had 45 Starbursts.

\]",The answer is 3,"Matthew had 27 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 9 friends, how many crackers did each person eat?"
4,2," To determine how many cases of 6 boxes plus extra boxes Mary needs to deliver, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of boxes Mary sold:**
   Mary sold 9 boxes.

2. **Determine how many complete cases of 6 boxes can be made from 9 boxes:**
   To find out how many complete cases of 6 boxes can be made, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per case:
   \[
   \frac{9}{6} = 1.5
   \]
   This means Mary can make 1 complete case and have some extra boxes left over.

3. **Find out how many extra boxes are left after making the complete cases:**
   To find the number of extra boxes, we multiply the number of complete cases by the number of boxes per case and subtract this from the total number of boxes:
   \[
   9 - (1 \times 6) = 9 - 6 = 3
   \]
   So, Mary has 3 extra boxes.

3,3," To determine how many Skittles each person ate, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many Skittles Samuel gave to each friend:**
   Samuel had 14 Skittles and he gave them equally to his 4 friends. We need to divide the total number of Skittles by the number of friends.
   \[
   \frac{14}{4} = 3 \text{ R } 2
   \]
   This means that each friend gets 3 Skittles, and there are 2 Skittles left over.

2. **Determine how many Skittles Samuel ate:**
   After giving Skittles to his friends, Samuel ate the remaining Skittles. From the division above, we know there are 2 Skittles left.
   \[
   \text{Samuel ate } 2 \text{ Skittles}
   \]

3. **Determine how many Skittles each friend ate:**
   Each friend received 3 Skittles.

4. **Summarize the final answer:**
   Each friend ate 3 Skittles, and Samuel ate 2 Skittles. The problem asks for the number of Skittles each person ate, but it does not specify which person. Since the problem does not specify a specific person, we can consider the answer for each friend and Samuel separately. However, if we interpret the problem to mean how many Skittles each friend ate, the answer is:

2,2," To determine how many Skittles each classmate gets, we need to perform a division of the total number of Skittles by the number of classmates. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the total number of Skittles: 20.
2. Identify the number of classmates: 8.
3. Perform the division: \(20 \div 8\).

When we divide 20 by 8, we get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 4. This means that each classmate gets 2 Skittles, and there are 4 Skittles left over. Since the problem asks how many Skittles each classmate gets, we focus on the quotient.

Therefore, each classmate gets \(\boxed{2}\) Skittles.",The answer is 2,"If Lillian split 20 Skittles between 8 people in her class and kept the left overs, how many Skittles did each classmate get?"
0,0," To determine how many Lemon Heads Patricia has left after eating 15, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of Lemon Heads Patricia initially had.
2. Subtract the number of Lemon Heads she ate from the initial total.

However, the problem does not specify the initial number of Lemon Heads Patricia had. Since Lemon Heads come in packages of 3, we can assume she started with a multiple of 3. For the sake of this problem, let's assume she started with a certain number of packages, say \( n \) packages. Then the total number of Lemon Heads she initially had is \( 3n \).

If Patricia ate 15 Lemon Heads, the number of Lemon Heads she has left is:
\[ 3n - 15 \]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( n \), we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume she started with a specific number of packages, we can solve it accordingly. For example, if she started with 5 packages (which is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) Lemon Heads), then after eating 15 Lemon Heads, she would have:
\[ 15 - 15 = 0 \]

If she started with 6 packages (which is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) Lemon Heads), then after eating 15 Lemon Heads, she would have:
\[ 18 - 15 = 3 \]

Since the problem does not specify the initial number of packages, the most logical assumption based on the information given is that she started with a number of packages that would make the problem solvable with the given data. Therefore, the most reasonable assumption is she started with 5 packages, and the answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]",The answer is 0,Lemon heads come in packages of 3. Patricia ate 15 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?
9,9," To determine how many crackers Betty has left after eating some, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of crackers Betty initially had.
2. Identify the number of crackers Betty ate.
3. Subtract the number of crackers Betty ate from the total number of crackers she initially had.

Since the problem does not specify the initial number of packages of crackers Betty had, we can assume she had at least enough to cover the 45 crackers she ate. The smallest number of packages she could have had is 3 (since each package contains 18 crackers, and \(3 \times 18 = 54\)).

Let's assume Betty had 3 packages of crackers. Therefore, the total number of crackers she initially had is:
\[3 \times 18 = 54\]

Next, we subtract the number of crackers Betty ate from the total number of crackers she initially had:
\[54 - 45 = 9\]

So, the number of crackers Betty has left is:
\[\boxed{9}\]",The answer is 9,Crackers come in packages of 18. Betty ate 45 crackers. How many crackers does she have left?
0,0," To determine how many Skittles Juan has left after eating 24 Skittles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many packages of Skittles Juan initially had.
2. Calculate how many Skittles Juan has left after eating 24 Skittles.

First, let's find out how many packages of Skittles Juan initially had. Since each package contains 6 Skittles, we can calculate the number of packages by dividing the total number of Skittles Juan ate by the number of Skittles per package:

\[
\text{Number of packages} = \frac{24 \text{ Skittles}}{6 \text{ Skittles per package}} = 4 \text{ packages}
\]

This means Juan initially had 4 packages of Skittles. Since each package contains 6 Skittles, the total number of Skittles Juan initially had is:

\[
\text{Total Skittles initially} = 4 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ Skittles per package} = 24 \text{ Skittles}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many Skittles Juan has left after eating 24 Skittles. Since Juan ate 24 Skittles and he initially had 24 Skittles, the number of Skittles he has left is:

\[
\text{Skittles left} = 24 \text{ Skittles} - 24 \text{ Skittles} = 0 \text{ Skittles}
\]

Therefore, the number of Skittles Juan has left is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]",The answer is 0,Skittles come in packages of 6. Juan ate 24 Skittles. How many Skittles does he have left?
3,3," To determine how many Sweettarts each person ate, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many Sweettarts Virginia gave to each friend:**
   Virginia had 13 Sweettarts and she gave them equally to her 4 friends. We need to divide 13 by 4.
   \[
   13 \div 4 = 3 \text{ R } 1
   \]
   This means each friend gets 3 Sweettarts, and there is 1 Sweettart left over.

2. **Determine how many Sweettarts Virginia ate:**
   After giving out the Sweettarts, Virginia has 1 Sweettart left. Therefore, she ate 1 Sweettart.

3. **Determine how many Sweettarts each friend ate:**
   Each friend received 3 Sweettarts.

So, the number of Sweettarts each friend ate is \(\boxed{3}\).",The answer is 3,"Virginia had 13 Sweettarts. If Virginia gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her 4 friends and then she ate what was left, how many Sweettarts did each person eat?"
9,9," To determine how many cases of 6 boxes Shirley needs to deliver, we start by noting that each case contains 6 boxes. We need to find out how many such cases are required to make up the total of 54 boxes.

We can do this by dividing the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per case:
\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

This division tells us that Shirley needs to deliver 9 cases of 6 boxes each to account for all 54 boxes. Therefore, the number of cases Shirley needs to deliver is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]",The answer is 9,Shirley sold 54 boxes of Trefoils. How many cases of 6 boxes does Shirley need to deliver?
54,5," To determine how many Atomic Fireballs Barbara has left after eating 59, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of Atomic Fireballs Barbara initially had.**
   Since Atomic fireballs come in packages of 9, we need to find out how many complete packages she started with. We do this by dividing the total number of Atomic Fireballs she ate by the number of fireballs per package.

   \[
   \text{Number of packages} = \frac{59}{9}
   \]

2. **Perform the division to find the quotient and the remainder.**
   When we divide 59 by 9, we get:

   \[
   59 \div 9 = 6 \text{ remainder } 5
   \]

   This means Barbara initially had 6 complete packages of Atomic Fireballs, and she has 5 atomic fireballs left over from these packages.

3. **Calculate the total number of Atomic Fireballs Barbara initially had.**
   Since each package contains 9 atomic fireballs, we multiply the number of packages by the number of fireballs per package:

   \[
   \text{Total atomic fireballs initially} = 6 \times 9 = 54
   \]

4. **Add the remaining atomic fireballs to the initial total.**
   Barbara initially had 54 atomic fireballs, and she has 5 atomic fireballs left over from the packages she ate. Therefore, the total number of atomic fireballs she has left is:

   \[
   \text{Total atomic fireballs left} = 54 + 5 = 59
   \]

5. **Subtract the atomic fireballs she ate from the initial total.**
   Barbara ate 5 atomic fireballs, so we subtract this from the initial total:

   \[
   \text{Atomic fireballs left} = 59 - 5 = 54
   \]
