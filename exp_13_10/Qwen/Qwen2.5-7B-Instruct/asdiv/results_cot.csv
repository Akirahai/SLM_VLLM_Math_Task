15,15," To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of large barrels (each holding 6 tons) and small barrels (each holding 5 tons) that can be used to transport 95 tons of oil while using the least number of barrels and ensuring every barrel is fully occupied.

Let's denote the number of large barrels by \( L \) and the number of small barrels by \( S \). The equation representing the total amount of oil is:
\[ 6L + 5S = 95 \]

We need to find non-negative integer solutions for \( L \) and \( S \) that minimize the total number of barrels \( L + S \).

First, we will express \( S \) in terms of \( L \):
\[ S = \frac{95 - 6L}{5} \]
For \( S \) to be an integer, \( 95 - 6L \) must be divisible by 5. We can check the divisibility by examining the remainder when 95 and \( 6L \) are divided by 5:
\[ 95 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \]
\[ 6L \equiv L \pmod{5} \]
So, \( 95 - 6L \equiv 0 - L \equiv -L \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), which means \( L \) must be a multiple of 5. Let's try the possible values for \( L \):

1. If \( L = 0 \):
\[ S = \frac{95 - 6 \cdot 0}{5} = \frac{95}{5} = 19 \]

\[ S = \frac{95 - 6 \cdot 5}{5} = \frac{95 - 30}{5} = \frac{65}{5} = 13 \]
\[ L + S = 5 + 13 = 18 \]

3. If \( L = 10 \):
\[ S = \frac{95 - 6 \cdot 10}{5} = \frac{95 - 60}{5} = \frac{35}{5} = 7 \]
\[ L + S = 10 + 7 = 17 \]

4. If \( L = 15 \):
\[ S = \frac{95 - 6 \cdot 15}{5} = \frac{95 - 90}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \]
\[ L + S = 15 + 1 = 16 \]

5. If \( L = 20 \):
\[ S = \frac{95 - 6 \cdot 20}{5} = \frac{95 - 120}{5} = \frac{-25}{5} = -5 \]
This is not a valid solution since \( S \) cannot be negative.

From the above calculations, the minimum number of barrels is 16, which occurs when \( L = 15 \) and \( S = 1 \).

Therefore, the number of large barrels that should be used is \(\boxed{15}\).",The answer is 15,"A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many large barrels should be used?"
1,1," To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of large and small barrels that can be used to transport 95 tons of oil while minimizing the total number of barrels and ensuring that every barrel is fully occupied.

Let's denote:
- \( L \) as the number of large barrels (each holding 6 tons).
- \( S \) as the number of small barrels (each holding 5 tons).

The total amount of oil transported can be expressed as:
\[ 6L + 5S = 95 \]

We need to find non-negative integer solutions for \( L \) and \( S \) that minimize the total number of barrels \( L + S \).

First, we will solve for \( S \) in terms of \( L \):
\[ 5S = 95 - 6L \]
\[ S = \frac{95 - 6L}{5} \]

For \( S \) to be an integer, \( 95 - 6L \) must be divisible by 5. We will check the values of \( L \) that satisfy this condition.

1. \( L = 0 \):
   \[ S = \frac{95 - 6 \cdot 0}{5} = \frac{95}{5} = 19 \]
   Total barrels: \( L + S = 0 + 19 = 19 \)

2. \( L = 5 \):
   \[ S = \frac{95 - 6 \cdot 5}{5} = \frac{95 - 30}{5} = \frac{65}{5} = 13 \]
   Total barrels: \( L + S = 5 + 13 = 18 \)

3. \( L = 10 \):
   \[ S = \frac{95 - 6 \cdot 10}{5} = \frac{95 - 60}{5} = \frac{35}{5} = 7 \]
   Total barrels: \( L + S = 10 + 7 = 17 \)

4. \( L = 15 \):
   \[ S = \frac{95 - 6 \cdot 15}{5} = \frac{95 - 90}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \]
   Total barrels: \( L + S = 15 + 1 = 16 \)

5. \( L = 20 \):
   \[ S = \frac{95 - 6 \cdot 20}{5} = \frac{95 - 120}{5} = \frac{-25}{5} = -5 \]
   (Not a valid solution since \( S \) cannot be negative)

From the valid solutions, the one that uses the least number of barrels is when \( L = 15 \) and \( S = 1 \), giving a total of 16 barrels.

Thus, the number of small barrels that should be used is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]",The answer is 1,"A transport company bought 95 tons of oil. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many small barrels should be used?"
6,6," To solve this problem, we need to determine how many long pieces (4 yards each) and short pieces (1 yard each) can be cut from a 27-yard rope to minimize the total number of pieces.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of long pieces (4 yards each).
- \( y \) as the number of short pieces (1 yard each).

The total length of the rope can be expressed as:
\[ 4x + y = 27 \]

Our goal is to minimize the total number of pieces, which is \( x + y \).

First, we solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 27 - 4x \]

Next, we substitute \( y \) into the expression for the total number of pieces:
\[ x + y = x + (27 - 4x) = 27 - 3x \]

To minimize \( 27 - 3x \), we need to maximize \( x \) while ensuring that \( y \) remains a non-negative integer.

We start by finding the maximum possible value of \( x \):
\[ 4x \leq 27 \]
\[ x \leq \frac{27}{4} \]
\[ x \leq 6.75 \]

Since \( x \) must be an integer, the maximum value of \( x \) is 6.

Now, we check if \( x = 6 \) results in a non-negative integer for \( y \):
\[ y = 27 - 4 \cdot 6 = 27 - 24 = 3 \]

So, when \( x = 6 \), \( y = 3 \), and the total number of pieces is:
\[ x + y = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

To confirm that this is the minimum number of pieces, we check the next possible value of \( x \), which is 5:
\[ y = 27 - 4 \cdot 5 = 27 - 20 = 7 \]
\[ x + y = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Since 12 pieces are more than 9 pieces, \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 3 \) indeed give the minimum number of pieces.

Therefore, the number of long pieces that should be cut is \(\boxed{6}\).",The answer is 6,"A worker needs to cut a 27-yard long rope into some long pieces at 4 yard each and some short pieces at 1 yard each. In order to make the least number of pieces, how many long pieces should be cut for?"
3,3," To solve this problem, we need to determine how many short pieces (1 yard each) and long pieces (4 yards each) should be cut from a 27-yard rope to minimize the total number of pieces.

Our goal is to minimize the total number of pieces, which is \( x + y \).

First, we solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 27 - 4x \]

Next, we need to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) that minimize \( x + y \):
\[ x + y = x + (27 - 4x) = 27 - 3x \]

To minimize \( 27 - 3x \), we need to maximize \( x \) because the coefficient of \( x \) is negative. The maximum value of \( x \) is determined by the condition that \( y \) must be a non-negative integer:
\[ y = 27 - 4x \geq 0 \]
\[ 27 \geq 4x \]
\[ x \leq \frac{27}{4} \]
\[ x \leq 6.75 \]

Since \( x \) must be an integer, the maximum value of \( x \) is 6.

Now, we calculate \( y \) when \( x = 6 \):
\[ y = 27 - 4 \cdot 6 = 27 - 24 = 3 \]

Thus, when \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 3 \), the total number of pieces is:
\[ x + y = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Therefore, to minimize the number of pieces, the worker should cut 3 short pieces (1 yard each).

\[
\boxed{3}
\]",The answer is 3,"A worker needs to cut a 27-yard long rope into some long pieces at 4 yard each and some short pieces at 1 yard each. In order to make the least number of pieces, how many short pieces should be cut for?"
8,8," To solve the problem of distributing 122 portfolios of paintings among 15 students, we need to perform the division of 122 by 15. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Set up the division**: We need to divide 122 by 15.
2. **Perform the division**:
   - 15 goes into 122 a certain number of times. To find out how many times, we perform the division \(122 \div 15\).
   - 15 goes into 122 eight times because \(15 \times 8 = 120\), which is the largest multiple of 15 that is less than or equal to 122.
   - Subtract \(120\) from \(122\) to find the remainder: \(122 - 120 = 2\).

So, the quotient is 8 and the remainder is 2. This means that each student will get 8 portfolios, and there will be 2 portfolios left over.

Therefore, the number of portfolios each student will get is \(\boxed{8}\).",The answer is 8,15 students split 122 portfolios of paintings. Each student should get the same number of portfolios. How many portfolios of paintings will each of them get?
2,2," To solve the problem of distributing 122 portfolios of paintings among 15 students, we need to perform a division and find the remainder. Here are the steps:

1. **Divide the total number of portfolios by the number of students:**
   \[
   122 \div 15
   \]

2. **Perform the division:**
   - 15 goes into 122 a total of 8 times because \( 15 \times 8 = 120 \).
   - Subtract 120 from 122 to find the remainder:
     \[
     122 - 120 = 2
     \]

3. **Determine the number of portfolios left:**
   The remainder from the division is 2, which means there are 2 portfolios left after each student gets an equal share.

Thus, the number of portfolios of paintings that will be left is \(\boxed{2}\).",The answer is 2,15 students split 122 portfolios of paintings. Each student should get the same number of portfolios. How many portfolios of paintings will be left?
9,9," To solve the problem of determining how many teams of 18 students can be formed from 172 students, we need to perform a division operation. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the total number of students and the number of students per team:**
   - Total number of students: 172
   - Number of students per team: 18

2. **Set up the division problem:**
   \[
   172 \div 18
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   - First, determine how many times 18 can go into 172.
   - 18 goes into 172 a certain number of times. We can estimate this by finding the largest multiple of 18 that is less than or equal to 172.
   - \( 18 \times 9 = 162 \)
   - \( 18 \times 10 = 180 \) (which is greater than 172, so we use 9)

4. **Calculate the quotient and the remainder:**
   - \( 172 \div 18 = 9 \) with a remainder.
   - To find the remainder, subtract the product of the quotient and the divisor from the total number of students:
   \[
   172 - (18 \times 9) = 172 - 162 = 10
   \]

5. **Interpret the result:**
   - The quotient (9) represents the number of complete teams that can be formed.
   - The remainder (10) represents the number of students left over who cannot form a complete team.

6. **State the final answer:**
   - The number of complete teams that can be formed is 9.

Therefore, the final answer is:

10,10," To solve the problem of determining how many students will not be on a team, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of students and the team size:**
   - Total number of students: \( 172 \)
   - Number of students per team: \( 18 \)

2. **Calculate the number of complete teams that can be formed:**
   - We divide the total number of students by the number of students per team:
   \[
   \frac{172}{18}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   - \( 172 \div 18 \) gives a quotient and a remainder.
   - First, find the quotient:
     \[
     172 \div 18 \approx 9.5556
     \]

8,8," To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of large and small trucks required to transport 134 tons of fruits, with each truck fully occupied and using the least number of trucks possible.

Let's denote:
- \( L \) as the number of large trucks (each carrying 15 tons).
- \( S \) as the number of small trucks (each carrying 7 tons).

The total weight of fruits transported by the trucks can be expressed as:
\[ 15L + 7S = 134 \]

We need to find non-negative integer solutions for \( L \) and \( S \) that minimize the total number of trucks \( L + S \).

First, we will try to maximize the number of large trucks since they can carry more weight and thus reduce the total number of trucks needed.

1. **Maximize \( L \):**
   - Start with the maximum possible value for \( L \) and check if \( S \) is a non-negative integer.

2. **Check \( L = 9 \):**
   \[ 15 \times 9 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 135 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 7S = 134 - 135 \]
   \[ 7S = -1 \]
   This is not possible since \( S \) must be a non-negative integer.

3. **Check \( L = 8 \):**
   \[ 15 \times 8 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 120 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 7S = 134 - 120 \]
   \[ 7S = 14 \]
   \[ S = 2 \]
   This is a valid solution. The total number of trucks is:
   \[ L + S = 8 + 2 = 10 \]

4. **Check \( L = 7 \):**
   \[ 15 \times 7 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 105 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 7S = 134 - 105 \]
   \[ 7S = 29 \]
   \[ S = \frac{29}{7} \]
   This is not an integer, so it is not a valid solution.

5. **Check \( L = 6 \):**
   \[ 15 \times 6 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 90 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 7S = 134 - 90 \]
   \[ 7S = 44 \]
   \[ S = \frac{44}{7} \]
   This is not an integer, so it is not a valid solution.

6. **Check \( L = 5 \):**
   \[ 15 \times 5 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 75 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 7S = 134 - 75 \]
   \[ 7S = 59 \]
   \[ S = \frac{59}{7} \]
   This is not an integer, so it is not a valid solution.

7. **Check \( L = 4 \):**
   \[ 15 \times 4 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 60 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 7S = 134 - 60 \]
   \[ 7S = 74 \]
   \[ S = \frac{74}{7} \]
   This is not an integer, so it is not a valid solution.

8. **Check \( L = 3 \):**
   \[ 15 \times 3 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 45 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 7S = 134 - 45 \]
   \[ 7S = 89 \]
   \[ S = \frac{89}{7} \]
   This is not an integer, so it is not a valid solution.

9. **Check \( L = 2 \):**
   \[ 15 \times 2 + 7S = 134 \]
   \[ 30 + 7S = 134 \]
   Therefore, the answer is \boxed{8}. \[ 7S = 134 - 30 \]
   \[ 7S = 104 \]
   \[ S = \frac{104}{7} \]
   This is not an integer, so it is not a valid solution.

2,2," To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of large and small trucks required to transport 134 tons of fruits, with each truck fully occupied and using the least number of trucks possible.

1. **Determine the maximum number of large trucks needed:**
   - Each large truck can carry 15 tons.
   - We need to find the maximum number of large trucks that can be used without exceeding 134 tons.
   - Calculate the number of large trucks: \(\left\lfloor \frac{134}{15} \right\rfloor\).

   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{134}{15} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.9333 \right\rfloor = 8
   \]

   - Using 8 large trucks, the total weight transported is:
   \[
   8 \times 15 = 120 \text{ tons}
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining weight to be transported:**
   - Subtract the weight transported by the large trucks from the total weight:
   \[
   134 - 120 = 14 \text{ tons}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of small trucks needed:**
   - Each small truck can carry 7 tons.
   - We need to find the number of small trucks required to carry the remaining 14 tons.
   - Calculate the number of small trucks: \(\left\lceil \frac{14}{7} \right\rceil\).

   \[
   \left\lceil \frac{14}{7} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2
   \]

4. **Verify the total number of trucks used:**
   - Total number of trucks = number of large trucks + number of small trucks:
   \[
   8 + 2 = 10

8,8," To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of large rooms (each for 3 people) and small rooms (each for 2 people) that will accommodate 26 people while minimizing the total number of rooms and ensuring all rooms are fully occupied.

Let's denote:
- \( L \) as the number of large rooms (each for 3 people)
- \( S \) as the number of small rooms (each for 2 people)

We need to satisfy the equation:
\[ 3L + 2S = 26 \]

We also want to minimize the total number of rooms, which is \( L + S \).

### Step 1: Express \( S \) in terms of \( L \)
From the equation \( 3L + 2S = 26 \), we can solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 26 - 3L \]
\[ S = \frac{26 - 3L}{2} \]

### Step 2: Ensure \( S \) is an integer
For \( S \) to be an integer, \( 26 - 3L \) must be even. Since 26 is even, \( 3L \) must also be even. Therefore, \( L \) must be even.

### Step 3: Test even values of \( L \) to find the minimum number of rooms

- For \( L = 4 \):
  \[ S = \frac{26 - 3 \cdot 4}{2} = \frac{26 - 12}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]
  Total rooms: \( L + S = 4 + 7 = 11 \)

- For \( L = 6 \):
  \[ S = \frac{26 - 3 \cdot 6}{2} = \frac{26 - 18}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]
  Total rooms: \( L + S = 6 + 4 = 10 \)

- For \( L = 8 \):
  \[ S = \frac{26 - 3 \cdot 8}{2} = \frac{26 - 24}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]
  Total rooms: \( L + S = 8 + 1 = 9 \)

- For \( L = 10 \):
  \[ S = \frac{26 - 3 \cdot 10}{2} = \frac{26 - 30}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \]
  \( S \) is negative, so this is not a valid solution.

  Total rooms: \( L + S = 8 + 1 = 9 \)

- If \( L = 10 \):
  \[ S = \frac{26 - 3 \cdot 10}{2} = \frac{26 - 30}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \]
  \( S \) is not a non-negative integer, so this is not a valid solution.

### Step 4: Identify the minimum number of rooms
From the valid solutions, the minimum number of rooms is 9, which occurs when \( L = 8 \) and \( S = 1 \).

### Final Answer
The number of small rooms that should be rented is \(\boxed{1}\).",The answer is 1,"A tourist group has 26 people.

In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many small rooms should be rented?"
19,19," To solve the problem, we need to determine how many baskets Mr. Lee used to pack the apples. We know the total number of apples and the number of apples per basket. We can use division to find the number of baskets.

Step 1: Identify the total number of apples.
The total number of apples is 495.

Step 2: Identify the number of apples per basket.
The number of apples per basket is 25.

Step 3: Divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per basket to find the number of baskets.
\[ \text{Number of baskets} = \frac{495}{25} \]

Step 4: Perform the division.
\[ 495 \div 25 = 19.8 \]

Since the number of baskets must be a whole number, and we cannot have a fraction of a basket, we need to check if 495 is exactly divisible by 25. Upon closer inspection, we see that 495 is not exactly divisible by 25, but the problem implies an exact division, so we need to recheck the problem statement or context, but based on the given numbers, the exact division is not possible with whole baskets.

However, if we assume the problem is correctly stated and we need to find the whole number of baskets, we can conclude that the number of full baskets is 19, and there will be a remainder of 10 apples (since \(495 - 19 \times 25 = 495 - 475 = 20\)).

But the problem asks for the number of baskets, and the exact division is 19.8, which means 19 full baskets and a remainder.

So, the number of full baskets is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]",The answer is 19,"Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are 25 apples in each basket, how many baskets of apples are there?"
20,20," To solve the problem, we need to determine how many apples are left unpacked after Mr. Lee packs them evenly into baskets with 25 apples each. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Identify the total number of apples and the number of apples per basket:**
   - Total apples: \( 495 \)
   - Apples per basket: \( 25 \)

2. **Divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per basket to find out how many full baskets can be made:**
   \[
   \frac{495}{25}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   - \( 495 \div 25 = 19.8 \)

4. **Since the number of baskets must be a whole number, we take the integer part of the division result:**
   - Integer part of \( 19.8 \) is \( 19 \)

5. **Calculate the total number of apples in the full baskets:**
   \[
   19 \times 25 = 475
   \]

6. **Subtract the number of apples in the full baskets from the total number of apples to find the number of apples left unpacked:**
   \[
   495 - 475 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of apples left unpacked is \(\boxed{20}\).",The answer is 20,"Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are 25 apples in each basket, how many apples were left unpacked?"
12,12," To solve this problem, we need to determine how many large groups (each with 7 members) and small groups (each with 3 members) can be formed from 90 members, such that the total number of groups is minimized.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of large groups (each with 7 members).
- \( y \) as the number of small groups (each with 3 members).

The total number of members can be expressed as:
\[ 7x + 3y = 90 \]

We want to minimize the total number of groups, which is \( x + y \).

First, we solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ 3y = 90 - 7x \]
\[ y = \frac{90 - 7x}{3} \]

For \( y \) to be an integer, \( 90 - 7x \) must be divisible by 3. We check the divisibility condition:
\[ 90 - 7x \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \]
\[ 90 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \]
\[ 7x \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \]

Since \( 7 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), we have:
\[ x \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \]

Thus, \( x \) must be a multiple of 3. We will test the smallest multiples of 3 to find the minimum number of groups.

1. **If \( x = 0 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 0}{3} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]
   Total groups: \( 0 + 30 = 30 \)

2. **If \( x = 3 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 3}{3} = \frac{90 - 21}{3} = \frac{69}{3} = 23 \]
   Total groups: \( 3 + 23 = 26 \)

3. **If \( x = 6 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 6}{3} = \frac{90 - 42}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \]
   Total groups: \( 6 + 16 = 22 \)

4. **If \( x = 9 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 9}{3} = \frac{90 - 63}{3} = \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]
   Total groups: \( 9 + 9 = 18 \)

5. **If \( x = 12 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 12}{3} = \frac{90 - 84}{3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]
   Total groups: \( 12 + 2 = 14 \)

6. **If \( x = 15 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 15}{3} = \frac{90 - 105}{3} = \frac{-15}{3} = -5 \]
   (Not possible since \( y \) cannot be negative)

From the above calculations, the minimum number of groups is achieved when \( x = 12 \) and \( y = 2 \), resulting in a total of 14 groups.

Thus, the number of large groups that should be made is \(\boxed{12}\).",The answer is 12,"A ballet class wants to divide its 90 members into some large groups at 7 members each and some small groups at 3 members each. In order to make the least number of groups, how many large groups should be made?"
2,2," To solve this problem, we need to determine how to divide 90 members into groups such that the number of groups is minimized, with some groups consisting of 7 members and others consisting of 3 members. Let's denote the number of large groups (each with 7 members) as \( x \) and the number of small groups (each with 3 members) as \( y \). The equation representing the total number of members is:

\[ 7x + 3y = 90 \]

Our goal is to minimize the total number of groups, which is \( x + y \). To do this, we need to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation and minimize \( x + y \).

First, we solve for \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ y = \frac{90 - 7x}{3} \]

For \( y \) to be an integer, \( 90 - 7x \) must be divisible by 3. Since 90 is divisible by 3, \( 7x \) must also leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 3. The number 7 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, so \( 7x \) will be divisible by 3 if \( x \) is a multiple of 3. Let's test the possible values of \( x \) starting from the largest possible value that keeps \( y \) non-negative.

1. If \( x = 12 \):
   \[ y = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 12}{3} = \frac{90 - 84}{3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]
   The total number of groups is \( x + y = 12 + 2 = 14 \).

2. If \( x = 9 \):
   \[ y = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 9}{3} = \frac{90 - 63}{3} = \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]
   The total number of groups is \( x + y = 9 + 9 = 18 \).

3. If \( x = 6 \):
   \[ y = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 6}{3} = \frac{90 - 42}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \]
   The total number of groups is \( x + y = 6 + 16 = 22 \).

4. If \( x = 3 \):
   \[ y = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 3}{3} = \frac{90 - 21}{3} = \frac{69}{3} = 23 \]
   The total number of groups is \( x + y = 3 + 23 = 26 \).

5. If \( x = 0 \):
   \[ y = \frac{90 - 7 \cdot 0}{3} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]
   The total number of groups is \( x + y = 0 + 30 = 30 \).

From the above calculations, the minimum number of groups is 14, which occurs when \( x = 12 \) and \( y = 2 \). Therefore, the number of small groups should be:

\[
\boxed{2}

16,16," To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cups were filled with tea given that there was 1,050 ml of tea in a pot and each cup contains 65 ml of tea. We can do this by dividing the total amount of tea by the amount of tea per cup.

Step 1: Identify the total amount of tea.
The total amount of tea is 1,050 ml.

Step 2: Identify the amount of tea per cup.
The amount of tea per cup is 65 ml.

Step 3: Divide the total amount of tea by the amount of tea per cup to find the number of cups.
\[ \text{Number of cups} = \frac{1050 \text{ ml}}{65 \text{ ml/cup}} \]

Step 4: Perform the division.
\[ \frac{1050}{65} = 16.153846153846153 \]

Since the number of cups must be a whole number, we take the integer part of the division result, which is 16. We can verify this by calculating the total amount of tea in 16 cups:
\[ 16 \times 65 = 1040 \text{ ml} \]
This leaves us with:
\[ 1050 - 1040 = 10 \text{ ml} \]
Since 10 ml is less than 65 ml, it cannot fill another cup. Therefore, the number of cups filled with tea is 16.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]",The answer is 16,"There was 1,050 ml of tea in a pot. Anna poured the tea into some cups. If there were 65 ml of tea in each cup, how many cups were filled with tea?"
10,10," To solve the problem, we need to determine how much tea was poured into the cups and then subtract that amount from the initial amount of tea in the pot.

1. **Determine the number of cups:**
   - We know that each cup contains 65 ml of tea.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of cups.
   - The total amount of tea poured into the cups is \( 65n \) ml.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - The initial amount of tea in the pot is 1,050 ml.
   - The amount of tea left in the pot after pouring into the cups is \( 1,050 - 65n \) ml.

3. **Find the number of cups:**
   - Since the total amount of tea in the cups is \( 65n \) and the total amount of tea in the pot is 1,050 ml, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     65n = 1,050
     \]
   - Solve for \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{1,050}{65}
     \]
     \[
     n = 16.153846153846153
     \]
   - Since \( n \) must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a cup), we need to check if 16 cups is a feasible solution:
     \[
     65 \times 16 = 1,040 \text{ ml}
     \]
   - This means 16 cups can hold 1,040 ml of tea, leaving:
     \[
     1,050 - 1,040 = 10 \text{ ml}
     \]

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - If 16 cups are used, the total amount of tea poured is 1,040 ml.
   - The amount of tea left in the pot is:
     \[
     1,050 - 1,040 = 10 \text{ ml}
     \]

Therefore, the amount of tea left in the pot is \(\boxed{10}\) ml.",The answer is 10,"There was 1,050 ml of tea in a pot. Anna poured the tea into some cups. If there were 65 ml of tea in each cup, how much tea was left in the pot?"
2,2," To solve this problem, we need to determine how many vitamins Gil takes in total before the bottle runs out and then find the difference between his usual daily intake and the total intake over the period the bottle lasts.

Step 1: Determine the number of days the bottle lasts.
The bottle contains 250 vitamins, and Gil takes 12 vitamins per day. To find out how many days the bottle will last, we divide the total number of vitamins by the number of vitamins Gil takes per day:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{250}{12} \]

Step 2: Calculate the exact number of days.
\[ \frac{250}{12} = 20.8333\ldots \]
Since Gil cannot take a fraction of a day's worth of vitamins, we consider only the whole number of days, which is 20 days. On the 21st day, the bottle will be empty.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of vitamins Gil takes in 20 days.
\[ \text{Total vitamins taken} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \]

Step 4: Determine how many vitamins are left in the bottle on the 21st day.
\[ \text{Vitamins left} = 250 - 240 = 10 \]
This means that on the 21st day, Gil will take only 10 vitamins.

Step 5: Calculate how many vitamins short of his usual 12 vitamins Gil is on the 21st day.
\[ \text{Shortage} = 12 - 10 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of vitamins short of his usual 12 vitamins that Gil is on the day the bottle runs out is \(\boxed{2}\).",The answer is 2,There are 250 vitamins in a bottle. Gil takes 12 vitamins per day. How many vitamins short of his usual 12 vitamins is Gil on the day the bottle runs out?
6,6," To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rabbits should be in each cage if the farmer wants to distribute 164 rabbits evenly among 17 cages. We will then find out how many more rabbits the farmer needs to buy to achieve this even distribution.

Step 1: Divide the total number of rabbits by the number of cages to find out how many rabbits should be in each cage.
\[ \frac{164}{17} = 9.647 \]
Since the number of rabbits in each cage must be a whole number, we need to round up to the next whole number, which is 10. This means each cage should have 10 rabbits.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of rabbits needed if each cage has 10 rabbits.
\[ 17 \times 10 = 170 \]
So, the farmer needs 170 rabbits in total to fill the cages with 10 rabbits each.

Step 3: Determine how many more rabbits the farmer needs to buy.
\[ 170 - 164 = 6 \]
The farmer needs to buy 6 more rabbits.

5,5," To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tarts should be in each box and then find out how many more tarts Mrs. Dalloway needs to make to have a whole number of tarts in each box.

Step 1: Determine the number of tarts per box.
We need to divide the total number of tarts by the number of boxes to find out how many tarts should be in each box.
\[ \text{Number of tarts per box} = \frac{85}{10} = 8.5 \]
Since we cannot have half a tart in a box, we need to round up to the next whole number, which is 9 tarts per box.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tarts needed.
If each box contains 9 tarts, then the total number of tarts needed is:
\[ \text{Total tarts needed} = 9 \times 10 = 90 \]

Step 3: Determine how many more tarts are needed.

Step 1: Divide the total number of books by the number of shelves.
\[ 4305 \div 83 \]

Step 2: Perform the division to find the quotient and the remainder.
\[ 4305 \div 83 = 51 \text{ R } 62 \]
This means that each shelf will have 51 books, and there will be 62 books left over.

Step 3: Determine how many more books are needed to make the total number of books a multiple of 83.
Since 4305 books leave a remainder of 62 when divided by 83, we need to find out how many more books are needed to reach the next multiple of 83. The next multiple of 83 after 4305 is:
\[ 83 \times 52 = 4316 \]
So, we need:

Let's denote the weight of one bag of chips as \( C \) grams and the weight of one bottle of juice as \( J \) grams.

First, we know that the weight of 2 bags of chips is 800 grams. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 2C = 800 \]
Solving for \( C \), we get:
\[ C = \frac{800}{2} = 400 \]
So, the weight of one bag of chips is 400 grams.

Next, we know that the total weight of 5 bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 grams. Since 2 kg 200 grams is equal to 2200 grams, we can write the equation:
\[ 5C + 4J = 2200 \]
We already know that \( C = 400 \), so we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 5(400) + 4J = 2200 \]
\[ 2000 + 4J = 2200 \]
Subtracting 2000 from both sides, we get:
\[ 4J = 200 \]
Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = \frac{200}{4} = 50 \]
So, the weight of one bottle of juice is 50 grams.

Now, we need to find how much heavier a bag of chips is than a bottle of juice. This is given by:
\[ C - J = 400 - 50 = 350 \]
Therefore, a bag of chips is 350 grams heavier than a bottle of juice. The final answer is:

First, we can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 grams:
\[ 5d = 100 \]

2. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 grams:
\[ 4d + 2j = 140 \]

We start by solving the first equation for \( d \):
\[ 5d = 100 \]
\[ d = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ d = 20 \]

Now that we know the weight of one diamond is 20 grams, we substitute \( d = 20 \) into the second equation:
\[ 4(20) + 2j = 140 \]
\[ 80 + 2j = 140 \]
\[ 2j = 140 - 80 \]
\[ 2j = 60 \]
\[ j = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ j = 30 \]

So, the weight of one jade is 30 grams. To find out how much heavier a jade is than a diamond, we subtract the weight of a diamond from the weight of a jade:
\[ j - d = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, a jade is \(\boxed{10}\) grams heavier than a diamond.",The answer is 10,The weight of 5 diamonds is 100 g. The total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. How much heavier is a jade than a diamond?

- \( S \) as the weight of a single bed in kg.
- \( D \) as the weight of a double bed in kg.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The weight of 5 single beds is 50 kg.
2. The total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( 5S = 50 \)
2. \( 2S + 4D = 100 \)

First, solve the first equation for \( S \):
\[ 5S = 50 \]
\[ S = \frac{50}{5} \]
\[ S = 10 \]

Now that we know the weight of a single bed (\( S = 10 \) kg), we can substitute this value into the second equation to find \( D \):
\[ 2S + 4D = 100 \]
\[ 2(10) + 4D = 100 \]
\[ 20 + 4D = 100 \]
\[ 4D = 100 - 20 \]
\[ 4D = 80 \]
\[ D = \frac{80}{4} \]
\[ D = 20 \]

Now we know the weight of a double bed (\( D = 20 \) kg).

To find how much heavier a double bed is compared to a single bed, we subtract the weight of a single bed from the weight of a double bed:
\[ D - S = 20 - 10 \]
\[ D - S = 10 \]

Therefore, a double bed is \(\boxed{10}\) kg heavier than a single bed.",The answer is 10,The weight of 5 single beds is 50 kg. The total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg. How much heavier is a double bed than a single bed?

Let's define:
- \( g \) as the weight of one glass bottle in grams.
- \( p \) as the weight of one plastic bottle in grams.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 grams.
2. The total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1500 grams (since 1 kg 50 g = 1500 g).

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( 3g = 600 \)
2. \( 4g + 5p = 1500 \)

First, solve the first equation for \( g \):
\[ 3g = 600 \]
\[ g = \frac{600}{3} \]
\[ g = 200 \]

Now that we know the weight of one glass bottle is 200 grams, we can substitute \( g = 200 \) into the second equation:
\[ 4(200) + 5p = 1500 \]
\[ 800 + 5p = 1500 \]
\[ 5p = 1500 - 800 \]
\[ 5p = 700 \]
\[ p = \frac{700}{5} \]
\[ p = 140 \]

So, the weight of one plastic bottle is 140 grams. To find out how much heavier a glass bottle is than a plastic bottle, we subtract the weight of a plastic bottle from the weight of a glass bottle:
\[ g - p = 200 - 140 = 60 \]

Therefore, a glass bottle is \(\boxed{60}\) grams heavier than a plastic bottle.",The answer is 150,The weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g. The total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g. How much heavier is a glass bottle than a plastic bottle?
5,5," To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of a fox and the weight of a dog, and then find the difference between the two weights.

Let's denote the weight of one fox as \( F \) and the weight of one dog as \( D \).

First, we know from the problem that the weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 5F = 25 \]
To find the weight of one fox, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ F = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]
So, the weight of one fox is 5 kg.

Next, we know that the total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3F + 5D = 65 \]
We already know that \( F = 5 \), so we substitute 5 for \( F \) in the equation:
\[ 3(5) + 5D = 65 \]
\[ 15 + 5D = 65 \]
To find the weight of one dog, we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 5D = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 5D = 50 \]
Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ D = \frac{50}{5} = 10 \]
So, the weight of one dog is 10 kg.

Now, we need to find how much heavier a dog is than a fox. We do this by subtracting the weight of a fox from the weight of a dog:
\[ D - F = 10 - 5 = 5 \]
Therefore, a dog is 5 kg heavier than a fox.

The weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g, which is:
\[ 5 \times 1000 + 200 = 5200 \text{ g} \]

So, the weight of one watermelon is:
\[ \frac{5200}{4} = 1300 \text{ g} \]

Next, we know the total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g, which is:
\[ 5 \times 1000 + 700 = 5700 \text{ g} \]

The weight of 3 watermelons is:
\[ 3 \times 1300 = 3900 \text{ g} \]

Let the weight of one pineapple be \( p \) grams. Then the weight of 4 pineapples is \( 4p \) grams. According to the problem, the total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5700 grams, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3900 + 4p = 5700 \]

Solving for \( p \):
\[ 4p = 5700 - 3900 \]
\[ 4p = 1800 \]
\[ p = \frac{1800}{4} = 450 \text{ g} \]

Now, we need to find how much heavier a watermelon is than a pineapple:

\[ 4c = 800 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = \frac{800}{4} = 200 \]
So, the weight of one cake is 200 grams.

Next, we know that the total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 grams, which is equivalent to 1100 grams. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 3c + 5b = 1100 \]
Substituting the value of \( c \) (which is 200 grams) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3(200) + 5b = 1100 \]
\[ 600 + 5b = 1100 \]
Subtracting 600 from both sides, we get:
\[ 5b = 500 \]

14:10,14:10," To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes for each worker to assemble a bike. The times are as follows:

- Worker A: 1 hour 30 minutes = 90 minutes
- Worker B: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Worker C: 1 hour = 60 minutes

First, we find the LCM of 90, 120, and 60. To do this, we start by finding the prime factorization of each number:

- \(90 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
- \(120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5\)
- \(60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^3\)
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^2\)
- The highest power of 5 is \(5\)

So, the LCM is:

\[
2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5 = 8 \times 9 \times 5 = 360
\]

The LCM of 90, 120, and 60 is 360 minutes. This means that every 360 minutes, all three workers will finish assembling a bike at the same time.

Next, we need to determine the time 360 minutes after 8:10. First, we convert 360 minutes into hours and minutes:

\[
360 \text{ minutes} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Adding 6 hours to 8:10:

2. Carpenter B installs a door every 1 hour 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes.
3. Carpenter C installs a door every 1 hour 40 minutes, which is 100 minutes.

Now, we need to find the LCM of 40, 80, and 100.

First, we find the prime factorization of each number:
- \(40 = 2^3 \times 5\)
- \(80 = 2^4 \times 5\)
- \(100 = 2^2 \times 5^2\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^4\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\).

18,18," To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( n \) as the number of nickels.
- \( d \) as the number of dimes.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of nickels and dimes is 28.
2. Anna has 8 fewer nickels than dimes.

We can translate these statements into the following equations:
1. \( n + d = 28 \)
2. \( n = d - 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( d \):
\[ (d - 8) + d = 28 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2d - 8 = 28 \]

Add 8 to both sides to isolate the term with \( d \):
\[ 2d = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( d \):
\[ d = 18 \]

So, Anna has \(\boxed{18}\) dimes. 

To verify, we can check the number of nickels:
\[ n = d - 8 = 18 - 8 = 10 \]

6,6," Let's denote the number of marbles Mark gave to Evan as \( x \).

Initially, Mark has 24 marbles and Evan has 3 marbles. After Mark gives \( x \) marbles to Evan, the number of marbles each has changes as follows:
- Mark's new number of marbles is \( 24 - x \).
- Evan's new number of marbles is \( 3 + x \).

According to the problem, after the transfer, Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:
\[ 24 - x = 2(3 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

1. Expand the right side of the equation:
\[ 24 - x = 6 + 2x \]

2. To isolate \( x \), first add \( x \) to both sides of the equation:
\[ 24 = 6 + 3x \]

3. Next, subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 18 = 3x \]

4. Finally, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Mark gave Evan 6 marbles. To verify, we can check the final number of marbles each has:
- Mark's new number of marbles is \( 24 - 6 = 18 \).
- Evan's new number of marbles is \( 3 + 6 = 9 \).

Since 18 is indeed double 9, our solution is correct. Therefore, the number of marbles Mark gave to Evan is \(\boxed{6}\).",The answer is 6,Mark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles.

\[
C = 95 - A
\]

Next, substitute \( C \) in the second equation:
\[
(95 - A) + S = 87
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
95 - A + S = 87
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( S \):
\[
S = 87 - 95 + A
\]
\[
S = A - 8
\]

Now, we have \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[
S = A - 8
\]

To find \( A - S \):
\[
A - S = A - (A - 8)
\]
\[
A - S = A - A + 8

\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( A \) into the first equation
Substitute \( A = 11 - B \) into the first equation:
\[
(11 - B) + B + C = 24
\]
Simplify:
\[
11 + C = 24
\]
Solve for \( C \):
\[
C = 24 - 11
\]
\[
C = 13
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( B \) using the third equation
Now substitute \( C = 13 \) into the third equation:
\[
B + 13 = 18
\]
Solve for \( B \):
\[
B = 18 - 13
\]
\[
B = 5
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( A \)
Now that we have \( B = 5 \), substitute it back into the equation \( A = 11 - B \):
\[
A = 11 - 5
\]
\[
A = 6
\]

### Step 5: Find the total number of apples in the first and third bags
We need to find \( A + C \):
\[
A + C = 6 + 13
\]
\[
A + C = 19
\]

Thus, the number of apples in the first and third bags together is \(\boxed{19}\).",The answer is 19,Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples.

5,5," To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the worm to climb out of the 26-inch deep hole, given that it climbs 8 inches and then slides back 3 inches each day.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Net Progress:**
   - The worm climbs 8 inches each day.
   - It then slides back 3 inches.
   - Therefore, the net progress each day is \(8 - 3 = 5\) inches.

2. **Progress Before the Final Day:**
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the worm to be within 8 inches of the top of the hole.
   - If the worm is within 8 inches of the top, it can climb out in one final day without sliding back.

3. **Calculate the Number of Days to Reach Within 8 Inches:**
   - The hole is 26 inches deep.
   - The worm needs to be within 8 inches of the top to climb out in one final day.
   - Therefore, the worm needs to reach \(26 - 8 = 18\) inches.

4. **Days to Reach 18 Inches:**
   - Each day, the worm makes a net progress of 5 inches.
   - To find out how many days it takes to reach 18 inches, we divide 18 by 5:
     \[

46,46," To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of Rita, Peter, and Skeeter. Let's denote the weights of Rita, Peter, and Skeeter as \( R \), \( P \), and \( S \) respectively.

We are given the following information:
1. The total weight of Rita, Peter, and Skeeter is 90 pounds.
2. Rita and Peter weigh the same amount.
3. Peter and Skeeter weigh 68 pounds together.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( R + P + S = 90 \)
2. \( R = P \)
3. \( P + S = 68 \)

First, substitute \( R \) with \( P \) in the first equation:
\[ P + P + S = 90 \]
\[ 2P + S = 90 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( 2P + S = 90 \)
2. \( P + S = 68 \)

We can solve these equations step by step. Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate \( S \):
\[ (2P + S) - (P + S) = 90 - 68 \]
\[ 2P + S - P - S = 22 \]
\[ P = 22 \]

Now that we know \( P = 22 \), we can substitute \( P \) back into the second equation to find \( S \):
\[ P + S = 68 \]
\[ 22 + S = 68 \]
\[ S = 68 - 22 \]
\[ S = 46 \]

Thus, Skeeter weighs \(\boxed{46}\) pounds.",The answer is 46,"Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are penguins. They weigh 90 pounds altogether. Rita and Peter know they weigh the same amount. Peter and Skeeter know they weigh 68 pounds together. How much does Skeeter weigh?"

\text{men's track team,The," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the ratio of long-distance to short-distance runners for both the women's and men's track teams, and then compare these ratios.

**Step 1: Calculate the ratio for the women's track team.**

- Number of women competing in long-distance events: 14
- Number of women competing in short-distance events: 20

The ratio of long-distance to short-distance runners for the women's track team is:
\[
\frac{14}{20} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the ratio for the men's track team.**

- Number of men competing in long-distance events: 10
- Number of men competing in short-distance events: 16

The ratio of long-distance to short-distance runners for the men's track team is:
\[
\frac{10}{16} = \frac{5}{8}
\]

**Step 3: Compare the two ratios.**

To compare \(\frac{7}{10}\) and \(\frac{5}{8}\), we can find a common denominator or convert them to decimal form.

- Converting to decimal form:
  \[
  \frac{7}{10} = 0.7
  \]
  \[
  \frac{5}{8} = 0.625
  \]

Since \(0.625 < 0.7\), the ratio \(\frac{5}{8}\) is smaller than \(\frac{7}{10}\).

**Final Answer:**
The men's track team has a lower ratio of long-distance to short-distance runners.

\(\boxed{\text{men's track team}}\)",The answer is The,"At Newberry High School, 14 of the members of the women's track team compete in long-distance events and 20 compete in short-distance events.

\text{fall,Fall," To determine in which season Ian's catering company catered a higher ratio of small-scale to large-scale events, we need to calculate the ratio for both the fall and the winter seasons and then compare them.

**Step 1: Calculate the ratio for the fall season.**

- Number of small-scale events in the fall: 10
- Number of large-scale events in the fall: 16

The ratio of small-scale to large-scale events in the fall is:
\[
\frac{10}{16} = \frac{5}{8}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the ratio for the winter season.**

- Number of small-scale events in the winter: 7
- Number of large-scale events in the winter: 12

The ratio of small-scale to large-scale events in the winter is:
\[
\frac{7}{12}
\]

**Step 3: Compare the two ratios.**

To compare \(\frac{5}{8}\) and \(\frac{7}{12}\), we can find a common denominator or convert them to decimal form.

- Converting to a common denominator:
  - The least common multiple of 8 and 12 is 24.
  - \(\frac{5}{8} = \frac{5 \times 3}{8 \times 3} = \frac{15}{24}\)
  - \(\frac{7}{12} = \frac{7 \times 2}{12 \times 2} = \frac{14}{24}\)

Since \(\frac{15}{24} > \frac{14}{24}\), \(\frac{5}{8} > \frac{7}{12}\).

**Step 4: Conclusion.**

The ratio of small-scale to large-scale events is higher in the fall season.

\[
\boxed{\text{fall}}
\]",The answer is Fall,"In the fall, Ian's catering company catered 10 small-scale events and 16 large-scale events. In the winter, they catered 7 small-scale events and 12 large-scale ones. During which season did Ian's catering company cater a higher ratio of small-scale to large-scale events?"
Lisa's\ team,Lisa's," To determine which team had a higher ratio of wins to losses, we need to calculate the ratio of wins to losses for both teams and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the ratio of wins to losses for Lisa's team:
- Lisa's team won 8 games and lost 6 games.
- The ratio of wins to losses for Lisa's team is \(\frac{8}{6}\).

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[
\frac{8 \div 2}{6 \div 2} = \frac{4}{3}
\]
So, the ratio of wins to losses for Lisa's team is \(\frac{4}{3}\).

Next, let's calculate the ratio of wins to losses for Susan's team:
- Susan's team won 17 games and lost 14 games.
- The ratio of wins to losses for Susan's team is \(\frac{17}{14}\).

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 (since 17 and 14 have no common factors other than 1):
\[
\frac{17 \div 1}{14 \div 1} = \frac{17}{14}
\]
So, the ratio of wins to losses for Susan's team is \(\frac{17}{14}\).

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{4}{3}\) and \(\frac{17}{14}\). To compare these ratios, we can convert them to decimal form or find a common denominator. Let's use the common denominator method.

The least common multiple of 3 and 14 is 42. We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 14}{3 \times 14} = \frac{56}{42}
\]
\[
\frac{17}{14} = \frac{17 \times 3}{14 \times 3} = \frac{51}{42}
\]

Now we compare \(\frac{56}{42}\) and \(\frac{51}{42}\). Since 56 is greater than 51, \(\frac{56}{42}\) is greater than \(\frac{51}{42}\).

Therefore, the ratio of wins to losses for Lisa's team (\(\frac{4}{3}\)) is greater than the ratio of wins to losses for Susan's team (\(\frac{17}{14}\)).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{Lisa's\ team}
\]",The answer is Lisa's,"Last season, Lisa's soccer team won 8 games and lost 6 games. Her cousin Susan's team won 17 games and lost 14 games. Which team had a higher ratio of wins to losses?"

First, let's calculate the ratio for Ava:
- Ava baked 14 apple pies and 8 blueberry pies.
- The ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies for Ava is \(\frac{14}{8}\).

To simplify this ratio, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14 and 8, which is 2.
\[
\frac{14 \div 2}{8 \div 2} = \frac{7}{4}
\]
So, the simplified ratio for Ava is \(\frac{7}{4}\).

Next, let's calculate the ratio for Shannon:
- Shannon baked 12 apple pies and 4 blueberry pies.
- The ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies for Shannon is \(\frac{12}{4}\).

To simplify this ratio, we find the GCD of 12 and 4, which is 4.
\[
\frac{12 \div 4}{4 \div 4} = \frac{3}{1}
\]
So, the simplified ratio for Shannon is \(\frac{3}{1}\).

Now, we compare the two ratios:
- Ava's ratio: \(\frac{7}{4}\)
- Shannon's ratio: \(\frac{3}{1}\)

To compare these ratios, we can convert them to decimal form:
- \(\frac{7}{4} = 1.75\)
- \(\frac{3}{1} = 3\)

Since 3 is greater than 1.75, Shannon baked a higher ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies.

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{\text{Shannon}}\).",The answer is Shannon,Ava and Shannon are baking pies for a bake sale. Ava baked 14 apple pies and 8 blueberry pies. Shannon baked 12 apple pies and 4 blueberry pies. Who baked a higher ratio of apple pies to blueberry pies?
\text{Ezra's class,Ezra's," To determine which class has a higher ratio of pen users to pencil users, we need to calculate the ratio for each class and then compare them.

**Step 1: Calculate the ratio for Ezra's class.**

- Number of students taking notes in pen: 14
- Number of students taking notes in pencil: 20

The ratio of pen users to pencil users in Ezra's class is:
\[
\frac{14}{20}
\]

To simplify this ratio, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14 and 20, which is 2. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2, we get:
\[
\frac{14 \div 2}{20 \div 2} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

So, the simplified ratio for Ezra's class is:
\[
\frac{7}{10}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the ratio for Jackson's class.**

- Number of students taking notes in pen: 11
- Number of students taking notes in pencil: 17

The ratio of pen users to pencil users in Jackson's class is:
\[
\frac{11}{17}
\]

This ratio is already in its simplest form because 11 and 17 are both prime numbers and do not share any common factors other than 1.

**Step 3: Compare the two ratios.**

We need to compare \(\frac{7}{10}\) and \(\frac{11}{17}\). To do this, we can cross-multiply to compare the products:

- For \(\frac{7}{10}\) and \(\frac{11}{17}\):
  \[
  7 \times 17 = 119
  \]
  \[
  10 \times 11 = 110
  \]

Since 119 is greater than 110, \(\frac{7}{10}\) is greater than \(\frac{11}{17}\).

Therefore, Ezra's class has a higher ratio of pen users to pencil users.

\[
\boxed{\text{Ezra's class}}
\]",The answer is Ezra's,"In Ezra's class, 14 of the students take notes in pen and 20 take notes in pencil. In Jackson's class, 11 of the students take notes in pen and 17 take notes in pencil. Which class has a higher ratio of pen users to pencil users?"

- Number of students who preferred red: 14
- Ratio of blue to red: \(\frac{8}{14} = \frac{4}{7}\)

Next, let's calculate the ratio for Mrs. Doyle's class:
- Number of students who preferred blue: 10
- Number of students who preferred red: 13
- Ratio of blue to red: \(\frac{10}{13}\)

Now, we need to compare \(\frac{4}{7}\) and \(\frac{10}{13}\). To compare these fractions, we can find a common denominator or cross-multiply.

Cross-multiplying gives:
- For \(\frac{4}{7}\) and \(\frac{10}{13}\), we compare \(4 \times 13\) and \(10 \times 7\).
- \(4 \times 13 = 52\)
- \(10 \times 7 = 70\)

Since 52 is less than 70, \(\frac{4}{7} < \frac{10}{13}\).

Therefore, Mrs. Doyle's class had a higher ratio of students who preferred blue to students who preferred red.

\]

To simplify this ratio, we find the GCD of 11 and 14, which is 1. Since 11 and 14 have no common factors other than 1, the ratio is already in its simplest form:
\[
\frac{11}{14}
\]

So, the ratio for the Patterson wedding is \(\frac{11}{14}\).

**Step 3: Compare the two ratios.**

We need to compare \(\frac{4}{5}\) and \(\frac{11}{14}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator and compare the numerators.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 14 is 70. We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

\text{Both days,They," To determine on which day Tori caught a higher ratio of catfish to trout, we need to calculate the ratio of catfish to trout for each day and then compare them.

**Step 1: Calculate the ratio of catfish to trout for the first day.**

- Catfish caught on the first day: 5
- Trout caught on the first day: 6

The ratio of catfish to trout on the first day is:
\[
\frac{5}{6}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the ratio of catfish to trout for the second day.**

- Catfish caught on the second day: 10
- Trout caught on the second day: 12

The ratio of catfish to trout on the second day is:
\[
\frac{10}{12}
\]

**Step 3: Simplify the ratio for the second day.**

\[
\frac{10}{12} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

**Step 4: Compare the ratios.**

\[
\frac{5}{6}
\]

Since the ratios are equal, Tori caught the same ratio of catfish to trout on both days.

\boxed{\text{Both days}}",The answer is They,"Tori went on a two-day fishing trip. On the first day, she caught 5 catfish and 6 trout. On the second day, she caught 10 catfish and 12 trout. On which day of the fishing trip did Tori catch a higher ratio of catfish to trout?"
Georgetown Middle School,Georgetown," To determine which middle school has a lower ratio of violin to flute players, we need to calculate the ratio for each school and then compare them.

First, let's calculate the ratio of violin to flute players for Georgetown Middle School:
- Number of violin players: 14
- Number of flute players: 12

The ratio of violin to flute players for Georgetown Middle School is:
\[
\frac{14}{12} = \frac{7}{6}
\]

Next, let's calculate the ratio of violin to flute players for Seaside Middle School:
- Number of violin players: 6
- Number of flute players: 5

The ratio of violin to flute players for Seaside Middle School is:
\[

25,25," To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the number of loaves baked each day. Let's list the number of loaves baked each day and look for a pattern:

- Wednesday: 5 loaves
- Thursday: 7 loaves
- Friday: 10 loaves
- Saturday: 14 loaves
- Sunday: 19 loaves

Next, we will calculate the differences between consecutive days to see if there is a consistent pattern:

- Difference between Thursday and Wednesday: \(7 - 5 = 2\)
- Difference between Friday and Thursday: \(10 - 7 = 3\)
- Difference between Saturday and Friday: \(14 - 10 = 4\)
- Difference between Sunday and Saturday: \(19 - 14 = 5\)

We observe that the differences between consecutive days are increasing by 1 each time:

- Wednesday to Thursday: +2
- Thursday to Friday: +3
- Friday to Saturday: +4
- Saturday to Sunday: +5

Following this pattern, the next difference should be +6. Therefore, to find the number of loaves baked on Monday, we add 6 to the number of loaves baked on Sunday:

\[ 19 + 6 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread baked on Monday will be \(\boxed{25}\).",The answer is 25,"The Wholesome Bakery baked 5 loaves of bread on Wednesday, 7 loaves of bread on Thursday, 10 loaves of bread on Friday, 14 loaves of bread on Saturday, and 19 loaves of bread on Sunday.

   - Difference between the third and second page: \(24 - 16 = 8\)
   - Difference between the fourth and third page: \(32 - 24 = 8\)

   The difference between consecutive pages is consistently 8 stickers.

3. **Predict the number of stickers for the fifth page:**
   - Since the pattern is an increase of 8 stickers per page, we add 8 to the number of stickers on the fourth page.

- First shelf: 2 books
- Second shelf: 6 books
- Third shelf: 18 books
- Fourth shelf: 54 books

We can observe that each number is a multiple of 3. Let's check the relationship between the shelves:

- \(6 = 2 \times 3\)
- \(18 = 6 \times 3\)
- \(54 = 18 \times 3\)

From this, we can see that each number of books is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 3. Therefore, the pattern is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3.

To find the number of books on the fifth shelf, we multiply the number of books on the fourth shelf by 3:

- Level 4: 8 points
- Level 5: 12 points

We need to find the relationship between the level number and the points scored. Let's denote the points scored on the \( n \)-th level by \( P(n) \).

First, let's look at the differences between consecutive points:
- \( P(2) - P(1) = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
- \( P(3) - P(2) = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
- \( P(4) - P(3) = 8 - 5 = 3 \)
- \( P(5) - P(4) = 12 - 8 = 4 \)

We observe that the differences between consecutive points form a sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4. This suggests that the points scored on each level are increasing by an increment that itself increases by 1 each time.

To find the points scored on the sixth level, we need to continue this pattern. The next increment in the sequence of differences will be 5 (since the last increment was 4).

So, the points scored on the sixth level will be:

We can see that the differences between consecutive terms are not constant, so let's look at the sequence in another way. Notice that:

- 3 = 1^2 + 2
- 4 = 2^2 + 0
- 6 = 2^2 + 2
- 9 = 3^2 + 0

This doesn't seem to fit either. Instead, let's look at the sequence of the differences between the terms:

- 4 - 3 = 1

6,6," To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of quarters and dimes Kira has, given that she has a total of $1.20 and has minimized the number of coins.

Step 1: Define the variables.
Let \( q \) be the number of quarters and \( d \) be the number of dimes.

Step 2: Set up the equations.
The value of the quarters and dimes can be expressed as:
\[ 0.25q + 0.10d = 1.20 \]

We also need to minimize the total number of coins:
\[ q + d \]

Step 3: Simplify the value equation.
Multiply the entire equation by 100 to eliminate the decimals:
\[ 25q + 10d = 120 \]

Step 4: Simplify the equation further.
Divide the entire equation by 5:
\[ 5q + 2d = 24 \]

Step 5: Solve for one variable in terms of the other.
Solve for \( d \):
\[ 2d = 24 - 5q \]
\[ d = \frac{24 - 5q}{2} \]

Step 6: Ensure \( d \) is an integer.
For \( d \) to be an integer, \( 24 - 5q \) must be even. Since 24 is even, \( 5q \) must also be even. Therefore, \( q \) must be even.

Step 7: Test even values of \( q \) to find the minimum number of coins.
Start with the smallest even value for \( q \) and check if \( d \) is a non-negative integer.

- If \( q = 0 \):
  \[ d = \frac{24 - 5 \cdot 0}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]
  Total coins: \( 0 + 12 = 12 \)

- If \( q = 2 \):
  \[ d = \frac{24 - 5 \cdot 2}{2} = \frac{24 - 10}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]
  Total coins: \( 2 + 7 = 9 \)

- If \( q = 4 \):
  \[ d = \frac{24 - 5 \cdot 4}{2} = \frac{24 - 20}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]
  Total coins: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \)

- If \( q = 6 \):
  \[ d = \frac{24 - 5 \cdot 6}{2} = \frac{24 - 30}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3 \]
  (Not a valid solution since \( d \) cannot be negative)

Step 8: Identify the minimum number of coins.
The minimum number of coins occurs when \( q = 4 \) and \( d = 2 \), giving a total of 6 coins.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]",The answer is 6,Kira has $1.20 in quarters and dimes. She has minimized coins altogether. How many coins does she have?

40,40," To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

1. Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.
2. Let \( q \) be the number of quarters.

Since the number of nickels and quarters is the same, we have:
\[ n = q \]

Next, we need to express the total value of the nickels and quarters in terms of \( n \).

3. The value of one nickel is $0.05.
4. The value of one quarter is $0.25.

The total value of the nickels is:
\[ 0.05n \]

The total value of the quarters is:
\[ 0.25q \]

The total value of all the coins is given as $12. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.05n + 0.25q = 12 \]

Since \( n = q \), we can substitute \( q \) with \( n \) in the equation:
\[ 0.05n + 0.25n = 12 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 0.30n = 12 \]

To find \( n \), divide both sides by 0.30:
\[ n = \frac{12}{0.30} \]
\[ n = 40 \]

Thus, the number of nickels is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]",The answer is 40,"You have $12 in nickels and quarters. If you have the same number of each kind of coin, how many nickels do you have?"

The total amount he earns from both jobs per week is given as $3,875. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total earnings:

\[
x + (x + 375) = 3875
\]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
2x + 375 = 3875

2. Set up the equations based on the given information.
3. Solve the equations to find the cost of the DVD player.

**Step 1: Define the variables.**

Let the cost of the DVD player be \( D \) dollars.
Let the cost of the movie be \( M \) dollars.

**Step 2: Set up the equations based on the given information.**

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The ratio of the cost of a DVD player to the cost of a movie is 9:2.
2. A DVD player costs $63 more than a movie.

From the ratio, we can write:
\[ \frac{D}{M} = \frac{9}{2} \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ 2D = 9M \]
\[ D = \frac{9M}{2} \]

From the second piece of information, we can write:
\[ D = M + 63 \]

**Step 3: Solve the equations to find the cost of the DVD player.**

We now have two equations:
1. \( D = \frac{9M}{2} \)
2. \( D = M + 63 \)

\text{Adams County College,Adams," To determine which college has classes with a lower ratio of men to women, we need to calculate the ratio of men to women for each college and then compare the two ratios.

**Step 1: Calculate the ratio of men to women at Greenpoint Technical College.**

- Number of men: 5
- Number of women: 6

The ratio of men to women is given by:
\[
\text{Ratio}_{\text{Greenpoint}} = \frac{\text{Number of men}}{\text{Number of women}} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the ratio of men to women at Adams County College.**

- Number of men: 15
- Number of women: 19

The ratio of men to women is given by:
\[
\text{Ratio}_{\text{Adams}} = \frac{\text{Number of men}}{\text{Number of women}} = \frac{15}{19}
\]

**Step 3: Compare the two ratios.**

To compare \(\frac{5}{6}\) and \(\frac{15}{19}\), we can cross-multiply to avoid dealing with fractions directly.

- Cross-multiplying \(\frac{5}{6}\) and \(\frac{15}{19}\):
  \[
  5 \times 19 = 95
  \]
  \[
  6 \times 15 = 90
  \]

Since \(95 > 90\), it follows that:
\[

Leon,Leon," To determine who has a higher ratio of cardio to resistance training, we need to calculate the ratio for both Jenna and Leon and then compare them.

First, let's calculate Jenna's ratio of cardio to resistance training:
- Jenna's cardio time: 18 minutes
- Jenna's resistance training time: 20 minutes

The ratio of cardio to resistance training for Jenna is:
\[
\frac{18}{20} = \frac{9}{10}
\]

Next, let's calculate Leon's ratio of cardio to resistance training:
- Leon's cardio time: 17 minutes
- Leon's resistance training time: 18 minutes

The ratio of cardio to resistance training for Leon is:
\[
\frac{17}{18}
\]

Now, we need to compare the two ratios:
- Jenna's ratio: \(\frac{9}{10}\)
- Leon's ratio: \(\frac{17}{18}\)

To compare these ratios, we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 18 is 90. We convert both ratios to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{9}{10} = \frac{9 \times 9}{10 \times 9} = \frac{81}{90}
\]
\[
\frac{17}{18} = \frac{17 \times 5}{18 \times 5} = \frac{85}{90}
\]

Now we compare \(\frac{81}{90}\) and \(\frac{85}{90}\):
\[
\frac{81}{90} < \frac{85}{90}
\]

Therefore, Leon's ratio of cardio to resistance training is higher than Jenna's.

- Anna's recipe calls for 3 kilograms of carrots and 6 kilograms of potatoes.
- The ratio of carrots to potatoes for Anna's recipe is \(\frac{3}{6}\).
- Simplifying \(\frac{3}{6}\) gives \(\frac{1}{2}\).

Next, let's calculate the ratio of carrots to potatoes for Richard's recipe:
- Richard's recipe requires 4 kilograms of carrots and 5 kilograms of potatoes.
- The ratio of carrots to potatoes for Richard's recipe is \(\frac{4}{5}\).

Now, we need to compare the two ratios:
- Anna's ratio is \(\frac{1}{2}\).
- Richard's ratio is \(\frac{4}{5}\).

To compare \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{4}{5}\), we can convert them to decimal form:
- \(\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\)
- \(\frac{4}{5} = 0.8\)

### Step 1: Calculate the ratio of A's to B's in the History class.
- Number of students who received A's: 20
- Number of students who received B's: 16

The ratio of A's to B's in the History class is:
\[
\frac{20}{16} = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the ratio of A's to B's in the Social Studies class.
- Number of students who received A's: 13
- Number of students who received B's: 10

The ratio of A's to B's in the Social Studies class is:
\[

Next, let's calculate the ratio for Yardley:
- Positive reviews in Yardley: 12
- Negative reviews in Yardley: 17

The ratio of positive to negative reviews in Yardley is:
\[
\frac{12}{17}
\]

Now, we need to compare the two ratios:
- Ratio in Richmond: \(\frac{7}{10}\)
- Ratio in Yardley: \(\frac{12}{17}\)

To compare these ratios, we can find a common denominator or convert them to decimal form. Let's convert them to decimal form for simplicity:
- \(\frac{7}{10} = 0.7\)
- \(\frac{12}{17} \approx 0.7059\)

Jake's\ stables,Jake's," To determine where there is a lower ratio of stallions to mares, we need to calculate the ratio of stallions to mares at both Jake's stables and Bridget's stables, and then compare these ratios.

**Step 1: Calculate the ratio of stallions to mares at Jake's stables.**

- Number of stallions at Jake's stables: 10
- Number of mares at Jake's stables: 15

The ratio of stallions to mares at Jake's stables is:
\[
\frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the ratio of stallions to mares at Bridget's stables.**

- Number of stallions at Bridget's stables: 17
- Number of mares at Bridget's stables: 18

The ratio of stallions to mares at Bridget's stables is:
\[
\frac{17}{18}

  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667
  \]
  \[
  \frac{17}{18} \approx 0.9444
  \]

Since \(0.6667 < 0.9444\), the ratio \(\frac{2}{3}\) is lower than \(\frac{17}{18}\).

**Conclusion:**

The ratio of stallions to mares is lower at Jake's stables.

\boxed{Jake's\ stables}",The answer is Jake's,At Jake's stables there are 10 stallions and 15 mares. At Bridget's stables there are 17 stallions and 18 mares. Where is there a lower ratio of stallions to mares?
\text{Ivan,Ivan," To determine who had a higher ratio of time spent watching TV to time spent reading, we need to calculate the ratio for both Ivan and Brenna and then compare them.

First, let's calculate Ivan's ratio:
- Ivan spent 20 hours watching TV and 14 hours reading.
- The ratio of time spent watching TV to time spent reading is \(\frac{20}{14}\).
- Simplify the fraction \(\frac{20}{14}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
  \[
  \frac{20 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{10}{7}
  \]
- So, Ivan's ratio is \(\frac{10}{7}\).

Next, let's calculate Brenna's ratio:
- Brenna spent 11 hours watching TV and 10 hours reading.
- The ratio of time spent watching TV to time spent reading is \(\frac{11}{10}\).
- This fraction is already in its simplest form.

Now, we need to compare the two ratios \(\frac{10}{7}\) and \(\frac{11}{10}\).

To compare these fractions, we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 10 is 70. Convert both fractions to have this common denominator:
- \(\frac{10}{7} = \frac{10 \times 10}{7 \times 10} = \frac{100}{70}\)
- \(\frac{11}{10} = \frac{11 \times 7}{10 \times 7} = \frac{77}{70}\)

Now, compare \(\frac{100}{70}\) and \(\frac{77}{70}\):
- Since 100 > 77, \(\frac{100}{70} > \frac{77}{70}\).

Therefore, Ivan's ratio \(\frac{10}{7}\) is greater than Brenna's ratio \(\frac{11}{10}\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{\text{Ivan}}\).",The answer is Ivan,"Last month, Ivan spent 20 hours watching TV and 14 hours reading. The same month, Brenna spent 11 hours watching TV and 10 hours reading. Who had a higher ratio of time spent watching TV to time spent reading?"

- First line: 23 words
- Second line: 26 words
- Third line: 29 words
- Fourth line: 32 words
- Fifth line: 35 words

We observe that the number of words increases by 3 for each subsequent line. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 23 and the common difference \(d\) is 3.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d

- Sunday: 4 sit-ups
- Monday: 8 sit-ups
- Tuesday: 16 sit-ups
- Wednesday: 32 sit-ups
- Thursday: 64 sit-ups

We observe that each day, the number of sit-ups is double the number of sit-ups from the previous day. This is a geometric sequence where the first term \(a = 4\) and the common ratio \(r = 2\).

The number of sit-ups on any given day can be expressed as:
\[ a_n = a \cdot r^{(n-1)} \]
where \(a_n\) is the number of sit-ups on the \(n\)-th day.

To find the number of sit-ups on Friday, we need to determine the number of sit-ups on the 6th day (since Sunday is the 1st day, Monday is the 2nd day, and so on).

Using the formula:

2,2," To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students are required to have 4 teams with an equal number of students on each team, and then find out how many more students need to sign up to reach that number.

Step 1: Determine the number of students needed per team.
Since we want 4 teams with an equal number of students, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of teams. However, we don't know the total number of students yet, so we'll use \( x \) to represent the total number of students needed.

Step 2: Set up the equation.
We need \( x \) students to be divisible by 4. This means \( x \) must be a multiple of 4. The smallest multiple of 4 that is greater than or equal to 14 is 16. So, we need 16 students in total to have 4 teams with an equal number of students.

Step 3: Calculate how many more students are needed.

1. **Determine the number of packages Stephen ate:**
   - Each package contains 7 Sweettarts.
   - Stephen ate 64 Sweettarts.
   - To find the number of packages, we divide the total number of Sweettarts by the number of Sweettarts per package:
     \[
     \frac{64}{7} \approx 9.142857
     \]
   - Since Stephen cannot eat a fraction of a package, we take the integer part of the division, which is 9 packages.

2. **Calculate the total number of Sweettarts in 9 packages:**
   - Each package contains 7 Sweettarts.
   - Therefore, the total number of Sweettarts in 9 packages is:
     \[
     9 \times 7 = 63
     \]

3. **Determine the number of Sweettarts left:**
   - Stephen ate 64 Sweettarts.

1. **Identify the initial number of candies**: Since the problem does not specify the initial number of candies, we need to assume that Shirley started with a certain number of candies. However, the problem only mentions that candies come in packages of 4 and that Shirley ate 10 candies. We need to determine how many candies she had before eating 10.

2. **Determine the number of packages**: Since candies come in packages of 4, we need to find out how many packages Shirley could have had initially. But the problem does not provide this information directly. Instead, we focus on the fact that she ate 10 candies.

3. **Calculate the remaining candies**: If Shirley ate 10 candies, we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of candies she had. However, since the initial number is not given, we can only express the remaining candies in terms of the initial number of candies minus 10.

4. **Express the final answer**: Let's denote the initial number of candies as \( x \). After eating 10 candies, the number of candies left is \( x - 10 \).

Since the problem does not provide the initial number of candies, the most precise answer we can give is in terms of the initial number of candies. However, if we assume the problem is asking for the number of candies left after eating 10 candies from an unknown initial amount, the answer is:

\[

Since the problem does not specify the initial number of Jawbreakers Sarah had, we can assume she started with a whole number of packages. However, the problem only asks for the number of Jawbreakers left after she ate 20.

Let's denote the initial number of Jawbreakers Sarah had as \( x \). Since each package contains 8 Jawbreakers, \( x \) must be a multiple of 8. But we don't need the exact initial number to find out how many are left after she ate 20.

The number of Jawbreakers left is given by:
\[ x - 20 \]

Since the problem does not provide the initial number of Jawbreakers, we can only express the answer in terms of the initial number minus 20. However, if we assume she started with enough Jawbreakers to have at least 20 left after eating 20, we can calculate the remainder when 20 is divided by 8.

Perform the division:
\[ 20 \div 8 = 2 \text{ R } 4 \]
This means that 20 divided by 8 gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 4. Therefore, after eating 20 Jawbreakers, Sarah has 4 Jawbreakers left.

\[ |x - y| = 100 \]

Since \( x = 91 \), we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ |91 - y| = 100 \]

The absolute value equation \( |91 - y| = 100 \) can be split into two separate equations:

\[ 91 - y = 100 \]
\[ 91 - y = -100 \]

We will solve each equation separately.

1. Solving \( 91 - y = 100 \):

\[ 91 - y = 100 \]
\[ -y = 100 - 91 \]
\[ -y = 9 \]
\[ y = -9 \]

2. Solving \( 91 - y = -100 \):

\[ 91 - y = -100 \]
\[ -y = -100 - 91 \]
\[ -y = -191 \]
\[ y = 191 \]

So, the other number can be either \( -9 \) or \( 191 \). Since the problem does not specify which number is larger, both solutions are valid. However, typically in such problems, we consider the positive solution unless otherwise specified.

\[
\frac{1}{3}x - 7 + 7 = 8 + 7
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3}x = 15
\]

Now, to solve for \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[

1. **Understand the problem statement:**
   - We are given that two-thirds of the number \( x \) plus six equals ten.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - Two-thirds of the number \( x \) can be written as \( \frac{2}{3}x \).
   - According to the problem, adding six to this value gives ten. Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3}x + 6 = 10
     \]

3. **Isolate the term involving \( x \):**
   - Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2}{3}x + 6 - 6 = 10 - 6
     \]
     \[
     \frac{2}{3}x = 4
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{3} \), which is \( \frac{3}{2} \):
     \[
     x = 4 \times \frac{3}{2}
     \]

     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 6 + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10
     \]

First, we need to combine the terms on the left side of the equation. To do this, we can rewrite \( x \) as \( \frac{3}{3}x \):
\[ \frac{3}{3}x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{16}{3} \]

Now, we can combine the fractions on the left side:
\[ \frac{3x - x}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \]

Since the denominators are the same, we can equate the numerators:
\[ 2x = 16 \]

1,1," Let's denote the unknown number by \( x \). According to the problem, one-third of the number added to one-fifth of the number gives eight-fifteenths of the number. We can write this as the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{5}x = \frac{8}{15}x
\]

To solve this equation, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator for 3 and 5 is 15. We can rewrite the fractions with this common denominator:

\[
\frac{5}{15}x + \frac{3}{15}x = \frac{8}{15}x
\]

Now, we can combine the terms on the left side:

\[
\frac{5x + 3x}{15} = \frac{8}{15}x
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{8x}{15} = \frac{8}{15}x
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can equate the numerators:

\[
8x = 8x
\]

This equation is true for any value of \( x \), but we need to find a specific value that satisfies the original problem. To do this, we can simplify the original equation by eliminating the common factor of \( \frac{8}{15}x \) from both sides. We can do this by subtracting \( \frac{8}{15}x \) from both sides:

\[
\frac{8x}{15} - \frac{8x}{15} = \frac{8}{15}x - \frac{8}{15}x
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
0 = 0
\]

This tells us that the equation is an identity, meaning it is true for all \( x \). However, we need to find a specific value that fits the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem by checking if there is a specific value that satisfies the equation. We can test \( x = 0 \):

\[
\frac{1}{3}(0) + \frac{1}{5}(0) = \frac{8}{15}(0)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
0 = 0
\]

This is true, but it is a trivial solution. To find a non-trivial solution, we can test other values. Let's test \( x = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{3}(1) + \frac{1}{5}(1) = \frac{8}{15}(1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{8}{15}
\]

To add the fractions on the left side, we need a common denominator, which is 15:

\[
\frac{5}{15} + \frac{3}{15} = \frac{8}{15}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{8}{15} = \frac{8}{15}
\]

This is true, so \( x = 1 \) is a solution. Therefore, the number is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]",The answer is 1,One-third of certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenth of the number. Find the number and check your calculation.

\[
\frac{1}{3}x - 5 + 5 = 10 + 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3}x = 15
\]

Now, to solve for \( x \), we need to eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
3 \cdot \frac{1}{3}x = 15 \cdot 3
\]
\[
x = 45

   - In an isosceles triangle, two of the angles are equal (the base angles).

2. **Consider the two possible cases:**
   - Case 1: The 54-degree angle is one of the base angles.
   - Case 2: The 54-degree angle is the vertex angle.

3. **Case 1: The 54-degree angle is one of the base angles:**
   - Let the base angles be \(54^\circ\) and \(54^\circ\).
   - The sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).
   - Therefore, the vertex angle would be:
     \[
     180^\circ - 54^\circ - 54^\circ = 72^\circ
     \]
   - This configuration is valid, but we need to check the other case to ensure we have the base angles.

4. **Case 2: The 54-degree angle is the vertex angle:**
   - Let the base angles be \(x\) and \(x\).
   - The sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     54^\circ + x + x = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     54^\circ + 2x = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     2x = 180^\circ - 54^\circ
     \]
     \[
     2x = 126^\circ
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{126^\circ}{2} = 63^\circ
     \]
   - So, the base angles are \(63^\circ\) and \(63^\circ\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The base angles of the isosceles triangle are either \(54^\circ\) and \(54^\circ\) (if the 54-degree angle is a base angle) or \(63^\circ\) and \(63^\circ\) (if the 54-degree angle is the vertex angle).

Since the problem does not specify which angle is the vertex angle or the base angle, we consider the most common and typical scenario where the given angle is not the vertex angle. Therefore, the base angles are:

\[
\boxed{63^\circ}
\]",The answer is 63,In an isosceles triangle one of the angles of a triangle is 54 degrees. Find the base angles of the triangle.

9,9," To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given and then solve for the number of hours Mary rented the bike.

Step 1: Define the variables.
Let \( h \) represent the number of hours Mary rented the bike.

Step 2: Set up the equation.
The total cost for renting the bike is the sum of the fixed fee and the hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours. The fixed fee is $17, and the hourly rate is $7. Mary paid a total of $80. Therefore, the equation is:
\[ 17 + 7h = 80 \]

Step 3: Solve the equation for \( h \).
First, subtract 17 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( h \):
\[ 7h = 80 - 17 \]
\[ 7h = 63 \]

Next, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( h \):
\[ h = \frac{63}{7} \]
\[ h = 9 \]

272,272," To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of boys in the school. Let's denote the number of boys by \( B \) and the number of girls by \( G \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of students in the school is 650.
2. The number of girls is 106 more than the number of boys.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \( B + G = 650 \)
2. \( G = B + 106 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( G \):
\[ B + (B + 106) = 650 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2B + 106 = 650 \]

Subtract 106 from both sides to isolate the term with \( B \):
\[ 2B = 544 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 272 \]

So, the number of boys in the school is \(\boxed{272}\).",The answer is 272,"There are 650 students in a school. If the number of girls is 106 more than the boys, how many boys are there in the school?"

\[ 3V + 5 = 44 \]

To find Vidya's present age, we need to solve this equation step by step. First, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3V + 5 - 5 = 44 - 5 \]
\[ 3V = 39 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ \frac{3V}{3} = \frac{39}{3} \]
\[ V = 13 \]

So, Vidya's present age is \(\boxed{13}\).",The answer is 13,"Vidya's mother's age is 5 years more than the three times of Vidya's present age. Find Vidya's present age, if her mother is 44 years old."
6,6," Step 1: Let's denote the number of books Priyanka has as \( P \).
Step 2: According to the problem, Sachin has 6 more than 6 times the number of books Priyanka has. This can be written as: \( S = 6P + 6 \), where \( S \) is the number of books Sachin has.
Step 3: We are given that Sachin has 42 books, so we can substitute \( S \) with 42 in the equation: \( 42 = 6P + 6 \).
Step 4: To find the value of \( P \), we need to solve the equation for \( P \). First, subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: \( 42 - 6 = 6P \).
Step 5: Simplify the left side: \( 36 = 6P \).
Step 6: Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( P \): \( P = \frac{36}{6} \).
Step 7: Simplify the right side: \( P = 6 \).

Therefore, Priyanka has 6 books.

12,12," To solve the problem, we need to determine the initial number of lollipops that Sushi's father bought. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the initial number of lollipops.
2. According to the problem, 5 lollipops were eaten by the children.
3. After the children ate the lollipops, 7 lollipops were left.

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:
\[ x - 5 = 7 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 5 = 7 \]

Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ x - 5 + 5 = 7 + 5 \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, the initial number of lollipops that Sushi's father brought is \( \boxed{12} \).",The answer is 12,"Sushi's father bought x lollipops. 5 were eaten by the the children. If 7 lollipops are left, how many lollipops did sushi's father bring?"

5,5," Let's denote Ariel's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem, after 15 years, Ariel's age will be \( A + 15 \). We are also given that at that time, her age will be four times her current age. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + 15 = 4A \]

Next, we need to solve this equation for \( A \). First, we will isolate \( A \) on one side of the equation by subtracting \( A \) from both sides:
\[ 15 = 4A - A \]
\[ 15 = 3A \]

Now, we solve for \( A \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Ariel's current age is \(\boxed{5}\).",The answer is 5,"After 15 years, Ariel will be four times as old as she is now. Determine her present age."
45,75," Let's denote the current age of the father as \( F \) and the current sum of the ages of the 5 children as \( S \). According to the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:

1. The current age of the father is equal to the sum of the ages of his 5 children:
   \[
   F = S
   \]

2. After 15 years, the sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father:
   \[
   (S + 5 \times 15) = 2(F + 15)
   \]
   Here, \( 5 \times 15 \) accounts for the 15 years that each of the 5 children will have aged, and \( F + 15 \) accounts for the 15 years that the father will have aged.

Now, let's substitute \( F = S \) into the second equation:
\[
(S + 75) = 2(F + 15)
\]
Since \( F = S \), we can replace \( S \) with \( F \) in the equation:
\[
(F + 75) = 2(F + 15)
\]
Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[
F + 75 = 2F + 30
\]
Subtract \( F \) from both sides:
\[
75 = F + 30
\]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[
45 = F
\]

Thus, the current age of the father is \(\boxed{45}\).",The answer is 75,The age of a father is equal to the sum of the ages of his 5 children. After 15 years sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father. Find the age of the father.
"17, 15, 46",21," Let's denote the present ages of the two sons as \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) and the present age of the father as \( F \). We are given the following information:

1. Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of the two sons was one-third of the father's age at that time.
2. One son is two years older than the other.
3. The sum of the present ages of the two sons is 14 years less than the father's present age.

First, let's express the information in mathematical equations.

From the second piece of information, we know:
\[ S_1 = S_2 + 2 \]

From the third piece of information, we know:
\[ S_1 + S_2 = F - 14 \]

From the first piece of information, we know that ten years ago, the sum of the ages of the two sons was one-third of the father's age at that time. Ten years ago, the ages of the sons were \( S_1 - 10 \) and \( S_2 - 10 \), and the father's age was \( F - 10 \). Therefore, we have:
\[ (S_1 - 10) + (S_2 - 10) = \frac{1}{3} (F - 10) \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ S_1 + S_2 - 20 = \frac{1}{3} (F - 10) \]
Multiplying both sides by 3 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[ 3(S_1 + S_2 - 20) = F - 10 \]
\[ 3S_1 + 3S_2 - 60 = F - 10 \]
\[ 3S_1 + 3S_2 - 50 = F \]

Now we have three equations:
1. \( S_1 = S_2 + 2 \)
2. \( S_1 + S_2 = F - 14 \)
3. \( 3S_1 + 3S_2 - 50 = F \)

We can substitute \( S_1 = S_2 + 2 \) into the second and third equations. First, substitute into the second equation:
\[ (S_2 + 2) + S_2 = F - 14 \]
\[ 2S_2 + 2 = F - 14 \]
\[ 2S_2 + 16 = F \]

Next, substitute \( S_1 = S_2 + 2 \) into the third equation:
\[ 3(S_2 + 2) + 3S_2 - 50 = F \]
\[ 3S_2 + 6 + 3S_2 - 50 = F \]
\[ 6S_2 - 44 = F \]

Now we have two expressions for \( F \):
\[ 2S_2 + 16 = F \]
\[ 6S_2 - 44 = F \]

Set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 2S_2 + 16 = 6S_2 - 44 \]
Subtract \( 2S_2 \) from both sides:
\[ 16 = 4S_2 - 44 \]
Add 44 to both sides:
\[ 60 = 4S_2 \]
Divide by 4:
\[ S_2 = 15 \]

Now substitute \( S_2 = 15 \) back into \( S_1 = S_2 + 2 \):
\[ S_1 = 15 + 2 = 17 \]

Finally, substitute \( S_2 = 15 \) into \( F = 2S_2 + 16 \):
\[ F = 2(15) + 16 = 30 + 16 = 46 \]

So the present ages of the two sons and the father are:
\[ \boxed{17, 15, 46} \]",The answer is 21,"Ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. One son is two years older than the other and sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. Find the present ages of all."
12,12," Let's denote the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the digits of the number, and \(a\) is the tens digit while \(b\) is the units digit. The number obtained by reversing the order of the digits is \(10b + a\).

According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Seven times the original number is equal to four times the reversed number.
2. The sum of the digits is 3.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
1. \(7(10a + b) = 4(10b + a)\)
2. \(a + b = 3\)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[7(10a + b) = 4(10b + a)\]
\[70a + 7b = 40b + 4a\]
\[70a - 4a = 40b - 7b\]
\[66a = 33b\]
\[2a = b\]

Now we substitute \(b = 2a\) into the second equation:
\[a + b = 3\]
\[a + 2a = 3\]
\[3a = 3\]
\[a = 1\]

Since \(b = 2a\), we have:
\[b = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\]

Therefore, the two-digit number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 1 + 2 = 12\).

To verify, we check the conditions:
1. Seven times the original number is \(7 \cdot 12 = 84\).
2. Four times the reversed number is \(4 \cdot 21 = 84\).
3. The sum of the digits is \(1 + 2 = 3\).

All conditions are satisfied, so the number is \(\boxed{12}\).",The answer is 12,Seven times a two digit is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits and the sum of the digits is 3. Find the number.
36,36," Let's denote the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the digits of the number, with \(a\) being the tens digit and \(b\) being the units digit. We are given two conditions:

1. The number is four times the sum of its digits.
2. The number is twice the product of its digits.

We can express these conditions as the following equations:
\[10a + b = 4(a + b)\]
\[10a + b = 2ab\]

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[10a + b = 4a + 4b\]
\[10a - 4a = 4b - b\]
\[6a = 3b\]
\[2a = b\]
\[b = 2a\]

Now, substitute \(b = 2a\) into the second equation:
\[10a + 2a = 2a(2a)\]
\[12a = 4a^2\]
\[4a^2 - 12a = 0\]
\[4a(a - 3) = 0\]

This gives us two possible solutions:
\[a = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad a = 3\]

Since \(a\) is a digit of a two-digit number, \(a\) cannot be 0. Therefore, \(a = 3\). Substituting \(a = 3\) back into \(b = 2a\), we get:
\[b = 2 \cdot 3 = 6\]

So, the two-digit number is:
\[10a + b = 10 \cdot 3 + 6 = 36\]

To verify, we check the conditions:
1. The sum of the digits is \(3 + 6 = 9\), and four times the sum is \(4 \cdot 9 = 36\).
2. The product of the digits is \(3 \cdot 6 = 18\), and twice the product is \(2 \cdot 18 = 36\).

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number is \(\boxed{36}\).",The answer is 36,A two digit number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits. Find the number.
63,63," Let's denote the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the digits of the number. The number is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits, so we can write the equation:
\[10a + b = 7(a + b)\]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[10a + b = 7a + 7b\]
\[10a - 7a = 7b - b\]
\[3a = 6b\]
\[a = 2b\]

We also know that when 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. This gives us the equation:
\[10a + b - 27 = 10b + a\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[10a + b - 10b - a = 27\]
\[9a - 9b = 27\]
\[a - b = 3\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(a = 2b\)
2. \(a - b = 3\)

We can substitute \(a = 2b\) into the second equation:
\[2b - b = 3\]
\[b = 3\]
Then, substituting \(b = 3\) back into \(a = 2b\):
\[a = 2 \cdot 3 = 6\]

So, the number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 6 + 3 = 63\).

To verify, we check the conditions:
1. The number 63 is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits:
\[63 = 7(6 + 3) = 7 \cdot 9 = 63\]
2. When 27 is subtracted from 63, the digits interchange places:
\[63 - 27 = 36\]
The digits of 36 are 3 and 6, which are the digits of 63 in reverse order.

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number is \(\boxed{63}\).",The answer is 63,"A number consisting of two digits, is equal to 7 times the sum of its digits. When 27 is subtracted from the number, the digits interchange places. Find the number."
45,45," Let's denote the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) is the tens digit and \(b\) is the units digit. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The sum of the digits is 9.
2. When the digits are reversed, the number increases by 9.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \(a + b = 9\)
2. \(10b + a = 10a + b + 9\)

Let's simplify the second equation:
\[10b + a = 10a + b + 9\]
Subtract \(a\) and \(b\) from both sides:
\[9b - 9a = 9\]
Divide both sides by 9:
\[b - a = 1\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(a + b = 9\)
2. \(b - a = 1\)

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together:
\[(a + b) + (b - a) = 9 + 1\]
\[2b = 10\]
\[b = 5\]

Now substitute \(b = 5\) back into the first equation:
\[a + 5 = 9\]
\[a = 4\]

So the digits are \(a = 4\) and \(b = 5\), and the original number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 4 + 5 = 45\).

To verify, we check the conditions:
1. The sum of the digits is \(4 + 5 = 9\).
2. When the digits are reversed, the number becomes 54, and \(54 - 45 = 9\).

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number is \(\boxed{45}\).",The answer is 45,"In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9. Find the number."
96,96," Let's denote the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the digits of the number. We know the following:

1. The sum of the digits is 15:
   \[
   a + b = 15
   \]

2. When the number is decreased by 27, the digits are reversed. This can be written as:
   \[
   10a + b - 27 = 10b + a
   \]

We now have two equations:
1. \(a + b = 15\)
2. \(10a + b - 27 = 10b + a\)

First, let's simplify the second equation:
\[
10a + b - 27 = 10b + a
\]
Subtract \(a\) and \(b\) from both sides:
\[
9a - 9b = 27
\]
Divide both sides by 9:
\[
a - b = 3
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(a + b = 15\)
2. \(a - b = 3\)

We can solve this system by adding the two equations:
\[
(a + b) + (a - b) = 15 + 3
\]
\[
2a = 18
\]
\[
a = 9
\]

Substitute \(a = 9\) back into the first equation:
\[
9 + b = 15
\]
\[
b = 6
\]

Thus, the two-digit number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 9 + 6 = 96\).

To verify, we check the conditions:
1. The sum of the digits is \(9 + 6 = 15\).
2. Decreasing 96 by 27 gives \(96 - 27 = 69\), which is the reverse of 96.

Both conditions are satisfied, so the number is \(\boxed{96}\).",The answer is 96,The sum of the digits of a two number is 15. The number is decreased by 27 the digits are reversed. Find the number.
93,93," Let's denote the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) is the tens digit and \(b\) is the unit digit. According to the problem, the tens digit is three times the unit digit, so we have the equation:
\[a = 3b.\]

Additionally, when the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. This gives us the equation:
\[10a + b - 54 = 10b + a.\]

We can simplify this equation by isolating the terms involving \(a\) and \(b\) on one side:
\[10a + b - 54 = 10b + a \implies 10a - a + b - 10b = 54 \implies 9a - 9b = 54 \implies a - b = 6.\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(a = 3b\)
2. \(a - b = 6\)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[3b - b = 6 \implies 2b = 6 \implies b = 3.\]

Now that we have \(b = 3\), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \(a\):
\[a = 3b = 3 \cdot 3 = 9.\]

So, the two-digit number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 9 + 3 = 93\).

To verify, we check if decreasing 93 by 54 gives the number with reversed digits:
\[93 - 54 = 39.\]
The digits of 39 are indeed the reverse of the digits of 93. Therefore, the number is \(\boxed{93}\).",The answer is 93,"In a two digit number, the tens digit is three times the unit digit. When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. Find the number."

1. The sum of the digits is 8:
\[a + b = 8\]

2. The difference between the number and the number formed by reversing the digits is 18:
\[10a + b - (10b + a) = 18\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[10a + b - 10b - a = 18\]
\[9a - 9b = 18\]
Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
\[a - b = 2\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[a + b = 8\]
\[a - b = 2\]

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together:
\[(a + b) + (a - b) = 8 + 2\]
\[2a = 10\]
\[a = 5\]

Next, we substitute \(a = 5\) back into the first equation:
\[5 + b = 8\]
\[b = 3\]

So, the two-digit number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 5 + 3 = 53\).

1. The sum of the digits is \(5 + 3 = 8\), which is correct.

180,180," To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed charge and the charge per kilometer. Let's denote the fixed charge by \( F \) and the charge per kilometer by \( C \).

We are given two scenarios:
1. For a journey of 10 km, the charge is $75.
2. For a journey of 15 km, the charge is $110.

We can set up the following system of linear equations based on these scenarios:
\[
F + 10C = 75 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
F + 15C = 110 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

To eliminate \( F \), we subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
\[
(F + 15C) - (F + 10C) = 110 - 75
\]
\[
5C = 35
\]
\[
C = 7
\]

Now that we have \( C = 7 \), we substitute this value back into equation (1) to find \( F \):
\[
F + 10 \cdot 7 = 75
\]
\[
F + 70 = 75
\]
\[
F = 5
\]

So, the fixed charge \( F \) is $5 and the charge per kilometer \( C \) is $7.

To find the charge for a journey of 25 km, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Total charge} = F + 25C
\]
\[
\text{Total charge} = 5 + 25 \cdot 7
\]
\[
\text{Total charge} = 5 + 175

864,1440," To solve this problem, we will use the relationship between speed, time, and distance. Let's denote the original speed of the train as \( v \) km/hr and the original time taken as \( t \) hours. The distance covered by the train is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = v \times t \]

We are given two conditions:
1. If the train's speed is increased by 6 km/hr, the time taken is reduced by 8 hours.
2. If the train's speed is decreased by 6 km/hr, the time taken is increased by 12 hours.

Let's express these conditions mathematically.

### Condition 1:
If the speed is \( v + 6 \) km/hr, the time taken is \( t - 8 \) hours. The distance remains the same, so we have:
\[ v \times t = (v + 6) \times (t - 8) \]
Expanding and simplifying this equation:
\[ vt = vt + 6t - 8v - 48 \]
\[ 0 = 6t - 8v - 48 \]
\[ 6t - 8v = 48 \]
\[ 3t - 4v = 24 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \]

### Condition 2:
If the speed is \( v - 6 \) km/hr, the time taken is \( t + 12 \) hours. The distance remains the same, so we have:
\[ v \times t = (v - 6) \times (t + 12) \]
Expanding and simplifying this equation:
\[ vt = vt - 6t + 12v - 72 \]
\[ 0 = -6t + 12v - 72 \]
\[ 6t - 12v = 72 \]
\[ t - 2v = 12 \quad \text{(Equation 2)} \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( 3t - 4v = 24 \)
2. \( t - 2v = 12 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From Equation 2, solve for \( t \):
\[ t = 2v + 12 \]

Substitute \( t = 2v + 12 \) into Equation 1:
\[ 3(2v + 12) - 4v = 24 \]
\[ 6v + 36 - 4v = 24 \]
\[ 2v + 36 = 24 \]
\[ 2v = -12 \]
\[ v = -6 \]

Since speed cannot be negative, we must have made a sign error. Let's recheck the signs and solve again carefully.

From Equation 2:
\[ t = 2v + 12 \]

Substitute \( t = 2v + 12 \) into Equation 1:
\[ 3(2v + 12) - 4v = 24 \]
\[ 6v + 36 - 4v = 24 \]
\[ 2v + 36 = 24 \]
\[ 2v = -12 \]
\[ v = 18 \]

Now substitute \( v = 18 \) back into Equation 2 to find \( t \):
\[ t = 2(18) + 12 \]
\[ t = 36 + 12 \]
\[ t = 48 \]

The distance \( D \) is:
\[ D = v \times t = 18 \times 48 = 864 \]

Thus, the length of the journey is \(\boxed{864}\) km.",The answer is 1440,"A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey."
18,18," Let's denote the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the digits of the number, and \(a\) is the tens digit while \(b\) is the units digit. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The sum of the digits is 9, so we have the equation:
   \[
   a + b = 9
   \]

2. Nine times the number is twice the number obtained by reversing the digits, so we have the equation:
   \[
   9(10a + b) = 2(10b + a)
   \]

First, let's simplify the second equation:
\[
90a + 9b = 20b + 2a
\]
Rearrange the terms to isolate \(a\) and \(b\):
\[
90a - 2a = 20b - 9b
\]
\[
88a = 11b
\]
Divide both sides by 11:
\[
8a = b
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(a + b = 9\)
2. \(b = 8a\)

Substitute \(b = 8a\) into the first equation:
\[
a + 8a = 9
\]
\[
9a = 9
\]
\[
a = 1
\]

Now substitute \(a = 1\) back into \(b = 8a\):
\[
b = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

So the two-digit number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 1 + 8 = 18\).

To verify, we check the conditions:
1. The sum of the digits is \(1 + 8 = 9\), which is correct.
2. Nine times the number is \(9 \cdot 18 = 162\), and twice the number obtained by reversing the digits is \(2 \cdot 81 = 162\), which is also correct.

Therefore, the number is \(\boxed{18}\).",The answer is 18,"The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. Also, nine times this number is twice the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits. Find the number."
\frac{7,7/9," Let's denote the original fraction as \(\frac{x}{y}\).

We are given two conditions:
1. If one is added to both the numerator and the denominator, the fraction becomes \(\frac{4}{5}\).
2. If five is subtracted from both the numerator and the denominator, the fraction becomes \(\frac{1}{2}\).

We can write these conditions as two equations:
1. \(\frac{x+1}{y+1} = \frac{4}{5}\)
2. \(\frac{x-5}{y-5} = \frac{1}{2}\)

First, let's solve the first equation:
\[
\frac{x+1}{y+1} = \frac{4}{5}
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
5(x+1) = 4(y+1)
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
5x + 5 = 4y + 4
\]
\[
5x - 4y = -1 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Next, let's solve the second equation:
\[
\frac{x-5}{y-5} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
2(x-5) = 1(y-5)
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
2x - 10 = y - 5
\]
\[
2x - y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(5x - 4y = -1\)
2. \(2x - y = 5\)

We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method. First, we'll eliminate \(y\) by making the coefficients of \(y\) the same in both equations. Multiply Equation 2 by 4:
\[
4(2x - y) = 4 \cdot 5
\]
\[
8x - 4y = 20 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]

Now subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:
\[
(8x - 4y) - (5x - 4y) = 20 - (-1)
\]
\[
8x - 4y - 5x + 4y = 20 + 1
\]
\[
3x = 21
\]
\[
x = 7
\]

Now substitute \(x = 7\) back into Equation 2:
\[
2(7) - y = 5
\]
\[
14 - y = 5
\]
\[
-y = 5 - 14
\]
\[
-y = -9
\]
\[
y = 9
\]

So the original fraction is \(\frac{x}{y} = \frac{7}{9}\).

To verify, we check the conditions:
1. \(\frac{7+1}{9+1} = \frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5}\)
2. \(\frac{7-5}{9-5} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\)

Both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the original fraction is \(\boxed{\frac{7}{9}}\).",The answer is 7/9,"Fraction becomes 4/5 , if one is added to both numerator and denominator. If however, 5 is subtracted from both, the fraction becomes 1/2. Find the fraction."
\frac{5,5/13," Let's denote the numerator of the fraction by \( x \) and the denominator by \( y \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The sum of the numerator and the denominator is 18.
2. If the denominator is increased by 2, the fraction reduces to \(\frac{1}{3}\).

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
\[ x + y = 18 \]
\[ \frac{x}{y + 2} = \frac{1}{3} \]

First, we solve the second equation for \( x \):
\[ \frac{x}{y + 2} = \frac{1}{3} \]
By cross-multiplying, we get:
\[ 3x = y + 2 \]
Rearranging this equation, we have:
\[ y = 3x - 2 \]

Next, we substitute \( y = 3x - 2 \) into the first equation \( x + y = 18 \):
\[ x + (3x - 2) = 18 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 4x - 2 = 18 \]
Adding 2 to both sides, we get:
\[ 4x = 20 \]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[ x = 5 \]

Now that we have \( x = 5 \), we substitute this value back into the equation \( y = 3x - 2 \):
\[ y = 3(5) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13 \]

So, the numerator \( x \) is 5 and the denominator \( y \) is 13. Therefore, the fraction is:
\[ \frac{5}{13} \]

To verify, we check the conditions of the problem:
1. The sum of the numerator and the denominator is \( 5 + 13 = 18 \).
2. If the denominator is increased by 2, the fraction becomes \( \frac{5}{15} = \frac{1}{3} \).

Both conditions are satisfied, so the fraction is \(\boxed{\frac{5}{13}}\).",The answer is 5/13,The sum of numerator and denominator of a fraction is 18. If the denominator is increased by 2 the fractions reduced to 1/3 . Find the fraction.
\frac{4,4/7," Let's denote the numerator of the original fraction by \( n \) and the denominator by \( d \). According to the problem, the numerator is 3 less than the denominator, so we can write the equation:
\[ n = d - 3 \]

Next, we are told that if the numerator is increased by 1 and the denominator is increased by 3, the fraction becomes equal to \(\frac{1}{2}\). This gives us the equation:
\[ \frac{n + 1}{d + 3} = \frac{1}{2} \]

We can substitute \( n = d - 3 \) into the second equation:
\[ \frac{(d - 3) + 1}{d + 3} = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{d - 2}{d + 3} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To solve for \( d \), we can cross-multiply:
\[ 2(d - 2) = 1(d + 3) \]
\[ 2d - 4 = d + 3 \]
\[ 2d - d = 3 + 4 \]
\[ d = 7 \]

Now that we have \( d = 7 \), we can find \( n \) using the first equation:
\[ n = d - 3 \]
\[ n = 7 - 3 \]
\[ n = 4 \]

Therefore, the original fraction is:
\[ \frac{n}{d} = \frac{4}{7} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{4}{7}} \]",The answer is 4/7,"The numerator of a fraction is 3 less than its denominator. If the numerator is increased by 1 and the denominator is increased by 3, the fraction becomes equal to 1/2. Find the original fraction."
82,82," Let's denote the original 2-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) is the tens digit and \(b\) is the units digit. According to the problem, the tens digit is 4 times the units digit, so we have the equation:
\[a = 4b.\]

When the digits are reversed, the new number is \(10b + a\). The problem states that the new number is 54 less than the original number, so we have the equation:
\[10a + b - (10b + a) = 54.\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[10a + b - 10b - a = 54,\]
\[9a - 9b = 54.\]
We can factor out the 9:
\[9(a - b) = 54.\]
Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
\[a - b = 6.\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(a = 4b,\)
2. \(a - b = 6.\)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[4b - b = 6,\]
\[3b = 6.\]
Solving for \(b\), we get:
\[b = 2.\]
Now we substitute \(b = 2\) back into the first equation:
\[a = 4b = 4 \cdot 2 = 8.\]

So the original number is \(10a + b = 10 \cdot 8 + 2 = 82\).

To verify, we reverse the digits of 82 to get 28. The difference between 82 and 28 is:
\[82 - 28 = 54,\]

\[ 5x - 28 + 28 = 232 + 28 \]
\[ 5x = 260 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total cost for tuition plus room and board is $2,584.
2. Tuition costs $704 more than room and board.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( T + R = 2584 \)
2. \( T = R + 704 \)

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( R \):

1. Calculate the area of the rectangle.
2. Use the given ratio to find the area of the triangle.

**Step 1: Calculate the area of the rectangle.**

The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given the length is 6 cm and the width is 4 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Area of rectangle} = 6 \, \text{cm} \times 4 \, \text{cm} = 24 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

**Step 2: Use the given ratio to find the area of the triangle.**

The ratio of the area of the rectangle to the area of the triangle is 2:5. This means that for every 2 units of area of the rectangle, the area of the triangle is 5 units. We can set up the following proportion:
\[ \frac{\text{Area of rectangle}}{\text{Area of triangle}} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Let the area of the triangle be \( A \). Then we have:

Step 1: Understand the ratio.
The ratio of the length to the width is 6:5. This means that for every 6 units of length, there are 5 units of width.

Step 2: Set up the proportion.
Let the width be \( w \). According to the ratio, we can write the proportion as:
\[
\frac{\text{length}}{\text{width}} = \frac{6}{5}
\]
Given that the length is 24 inches, we substitute the length into the proportion:
\[
\frac{24}{w} = \frac{6}{5}
\]

Step 3: Solve for \( w \).
To find \( w \), we cross-multiply:
\[
24 \times 5 = 6 \times w
\]
\[
120 = 6w

5,5," To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more uniforms the store owner should buy so that he can distribute the uniforms evenly among his six employees without any leftovers. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Determine the total number of uniforms needed:**
   The store owner has six employees and wants to give each employee the same number of uniforms. Let \( x \) be the number of uniforms each employee should receive. Therefore, the total number of uniforms needed is \( 6x \).

2. **Set up the equation:**
   The store owner currently has 583 uniforms. We need to find the smallest number \( x \) such that \( 6x \) is a multiple of 583. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   6x = 583 + k
   \]
   where \( k \) is the number of additional uniforms needed.

3. **Find the remainder when 583 is divided by 6:**
   To find \( k \), we first calculate the remainder when 583 is divided by 6:
   \[
   583 \div 6 = 97 \text{ remainder } 1
   \]
   This means:
   \[
   583 = 6 \times 97 + 1
   \]
   So, the remainder is 1.

4. **Determine the number of additional uniforms needed:**
   Since the remainder is 1, we need to buy enough uniforms to make the total number of uniforms a multiple of 6. Therefore, we need to buy:
   \[
   6 - 1 = 5
   \]
   more uniforms.

5. **Verify the solution:**
   If the store owner buys 5 more uniforms, the total number of uniforms will be:
   \[
   583 + 5 = 588
   \]
   Now, we check if 588 is divisible by 6:
   \[
   588 \div 6 = 98
   \]
   Since 588 is exactly divisible by 6, each employee will receive 98 uniforms, and there will be no extra uniforms.

Therefore, the store owner should buy \(\boxed{5}\) more uniforms.",The answer is 5,"A store owner had six employees and bought five hundred eighty-three uniforms for them. If he wanted to give each employee the same number of uniforms, how many more should he buy so he doesn't have any extra?"

455,5," To solve the problem of determining how many groups of 3 can be made from 15 shapes, we need to use the concept of combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter.

The formula for combinations is given by:
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]
where \( n \) is the total number of items, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, \( n = 15 \) and \( r = 3 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[
\binom{15}{3} = \frac{15!}{3!(15-3)!} = \frac{15!}{3! \cdot 12!}
\]

Next, we simplify the factorials. Notice that \( 15! = 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12! \). The \( 12! \) in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out:
\[
\binom{15}{3} = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12!}{3! \times 12!} = \frac{15 \times 14 \times 13}{3!}

260,260,"1. Let \( r \) be the number of restaurant owners and \( c \) be the number of clothing store owners.
2. Each restaurant owner receives 13 red flyers, so the total number of red flyers distributed is \( 13r \).
3. Each clothing store owner receives 20 blue flyers, so the total number of blue flyers distributed is \( 20c \).
4. According to the problem, the number of red flyers distributed is equal to the number of blue flyers distributed:
   \[
   13r = 20c
   \]
5. To find the minimum number of flyers of each color, we need to find the smallest positive integers \( r \) and \( c \) that satisfy this equation.
6. This equation can be rewritten as:
   \[
   \frac{r}{c} = \frac{20}{13}
   \]
7. The smallest integers \( r \) and \( c \) that satisfy this ratio are the least common multiples (LCM) of 20 and 13. Since 20 and 13 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), the LCM of 20 and 13 is:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(20, 13) = 20 \times 13 = 260

Enzo wins 5 tickets per game, so the total number of tickets Enzo won is \( 5E \).

Beatriz wins 11 tickets per game, so the total number of tickets Beatriz won is \( 11B \).

We are given that the number of tickets Enzo won is equal to the number of tickets Beatriz won, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 5E = 11B \]

To find the minimum number of games Enzo could have played, we need to find the smallest positive integer values for \( E \) and \( B \) that satisfy this equation. This is a problem of finding the smallest positive integer solution to the linear Diophantine equation \( 5E - 11B = 0 \).

The smallest positive integer solution to this equation can be found by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the coefficients of \( E \) and \( B \) when the equation is in the form \( 5E = 11B \).

This equation tells us that \( 7m \) must be a multiple of 9 and \( 9s \) must be a multiple of 7. To find the smallest such \( m \) and \( s \), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 9. Since 7 and 9 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), the LCM of 7 and 9 is simply their product:
\[ \text{LCM}(7, 9) = 7 \times 9 = 63 \]

This means that the smallest value of \( 7m \) that is a multiple of 9 is 63, and the smallest value of \( 9s \) that is a multiple of 7 is also 63. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[ 7m = 63 \]

Let's denote the number of sparrows by \( S \) and the number of parrots by \( P \). According to the problem, \( S \) and \( P \) are both multiples of 13 and 14 respectively, and \( S = P \).

Since \( S \) is a multiple of 13 and \( P \) is a multiple of 14, we can express \( S \) and \( P \) as:
\[ S = 13k \]
\[ P = 14m \]
where \( k \) and \( m \) are integers. Since \( S = P \), we have:
\[ 13k = 14m \]

This equation tells us that \( 13k \) must be a multiple of 14 and \( 14m \) must be a multiple of 13. The smallest \( k \) and \( m \) that satisfy this equation are the least common multiples (LCM) of 13 and 14. Since 13 and 14 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), the LCM of 13 and 14 is \( 13 \times 14 = 182 \).

So, the smallest \( k \) and \( m \) are:
\[ k = 14 \]
\[ m = 13 \]

Substituting \( k = 14 \) into the equation \( S = 13k \), we get:
\[ S = 13 \times 14 = 182 \]

Therefore, the smallest number of sparrows that Bill could have observed is:
\[ \boxed{182} \]",The answer is 182,"Bill observed two types of birds in the bushes: sparrows and parrots. While the sparrows were in flocks of 13, the parrots were in flocks of 14.

Let's denote the number of ducks by \( D \) and the number of cranes by \( C \). We know that:
\[ D = 13d \]
\[ C = 17c \]
where \( d \) and \( c \) are the number of flocks of ducks and cranes, respectively. Since the total number of ducks and cranes is the same, we have:
\[ 13d = 17c \]

We need to find the smallest positive integers \( d \) and \( c \) that satisfy this equation. This is equivalent to finding the smallest positive integer solution to the equation:
\[ 13d = 17c \]

This equation tells us that \( 13d \) must be a multiple of 17, and \( 17c \) must be a multiple of 13. The smallest such \( d \) and \( c \) will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 17 divided by their respective numbers. Since 13 and 17 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product:
\[ \text{LCM}(13, 17) = 13 \times 17 = 221 \]

Thus, the smallest \( d \) and \( c \) are:

2,2," To solve the problem, we need to determine how many Starbursts each of Sean's 18 friends received and how many Starbursts Sean ate. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of Starbursts each friend received:**
   Sean gave an equal number of Starbursts to each of his 18 friends. Let's denote the number of Starbursts each friend received by \( x \). Therefore, the total number of Starbursts given to his friends is \( 18x \).

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Since Sean originally had 45 Starbursts, the number of Starbursts left after giving some to his friends is \( 45 - 18x \). According to the problem, Sean ate the remaining Starbursts. So, the number of Starbursts each friend received is \( x \), and the number of Starbursts Sean ate is \( 45 - 18x \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Since the number of Starbursts each friend received is equal to the number of Starbursts Sean ate, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x = 45 - 18x
   \]
   To solve for \( x \), we first add \( 18x \) to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x + 18x = 45
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   19x = 45
   \]
   Next, we divide both sides by 19:
   \[
   x = \frac{45}{19}
   \]
   Since \( x \) must be a whole number (as you can't give a fraction of a Starburst), we need to check if 45 is divisible by 19. Performing the division, we get:
   \[
   45 \div 19 = 2 \text{ remainder } 7
   \]
   This means that each friend received 2 Starbursts, and there were 7 Starbursts left for Sean to eat. Therefore, the number of Starbursts each friend received is 2.

4. **Verify the solution:**
   If each friend received 2 Starbursts, then the total number of Starbursts given to his friends is \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \). The number of Starbursts left for Sean is \( 45 - 36 = 9 \). Since Sean ate the remaining Starbursts, he ate 9 Starbursts. However, the problem states that each person ate the same number of Starbursts, so we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints. The correct interpretation is that each friend received 2 Starbursts, and Sean ate the remaining 9 Starbursts, but the problem asks for the number of Starbursts each person ate, which is 2 for each friend.

Therefore, the number of Starbursts each person ate is \(\boxed{2}\).",The answer is 2,"Sean had 45 Starbursts. If Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Starbursts did each person eat?"

1 \text{ case and 3 extra boxes,2," To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cases of 6 boxes Mary needs to deliver, plus any extra boxes that are not enough to fill a full case.

Step 1: Determine the number of full cases.
Mary has 9 boxes of Do-Si-Dos. Each case contains 6 boxes.
To find out how many full cases she can make, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per case:
\[ \frac{9}{6} = 1 \text{ full case with a remainder} \]

Step 2: Calculate the remainder.
Since 9 divided by 6 is 1 with a remainder, we can find the remainder by subtracting the number of boxes in the full case from the total number of boxes:
\[ 9 - (1 \times 6) = 9 - 6 = 3 \]

So, Mary has 1 full case and 3 extra boxes.

The final answer is:

3,3," To solve the problem, we need to determine how many Skittles each of Samuel's friends received and how many Skittles Samuel ate. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Skittles**: Samuel had 14 Skittles initially.

2. **Number of Friends**: Samuel has 4 friends.

3. **Skittles per Friend**: To find out how many Skittles each friend received, we divide the total number of Skittles by the number of friends.
   \[
   \text{Skittles per friend} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5
   \]
   Since Samuel cannot give half a Skittle to each friend, we need to consider the integer part of the division. Each friend gets 3 Skittles, and there will be a remainder.

4. **Total Skittles Given to Friends**: Multiply the number of friends by the number of Skittles each friend received.
   \[
   \text{Total Skittles given to friends} = 4 \times 3 = 12
   \]

5. **Remaining Skittles**: Subtract the total Skittles given to friends from the initial number of Skittles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining Skittles} = 14 - 12 = 2

1. **Identify the total number of Skittles Juan started with:**
   - Since Skittles come in packages of 6, we need to know how many packages Juan had initially. However, the problem does not specify the number of packages. Therefore, we will assume Juan started with a certain number of Skittles, and we need to find out how many he has left after eating 24 Skittles.

2. **Determine the number of Skittles Juan ate:**
   - Juan ate 24 Skittles.

3. **Calculate the number of Skittles left:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of Skittles Juan started with.
   - After eating 24 Skittles, the number of Skittles left is \( x - 24 \).

4. **Since the problem does not provide the initial number of Skittles, we can only express the remaining Skittles in terms of \( x \):**
   - The number of Skittles left is \( x - 24 \).

However, if we assume Juan started with a multiple of 6 Skittles (since Skittles come in packages of 6), we can find a specific solution. Let's assume Juan started with \( 6n \) Skittles, where \( n \) is a positive integer.

5. **Calculate the number of Skittles left if Juan started with \( 6n \) Skittles:**
   - The number of Skittles left is \( 6n - 24 \).

6. **Find the smallest \( n \) such that \( 6n - 24 \geq 0 \):**
   - \( 6n - 24 \geq 0 \)
   - \( 6n \geq 24 \)
   - \( n \geq 4 \)

7. **Choose the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies the condition:**
   - The smallest integer \( n \) is 4.

8. **Calculate the number of Skittles left if \( n = 4 \):**
   - \( 6 \times 4 - 24 = 24 - 24 = 0 \)

Therefore, if Juan started with 24 Skittles (which is \( 6 \times 4 \)), he would have 0 Skittles left after eating 24 Skittles.
