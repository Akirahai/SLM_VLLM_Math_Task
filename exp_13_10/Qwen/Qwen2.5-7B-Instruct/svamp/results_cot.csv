Step 1: Identify the total number of crackers and cakes.
- Total crackers: 13
- Total cakes: 15

Step 2: Determine the maximum number of crackers and cakes each friend could receive if the numbers are equal.
- Since Matthew gave out equal numbers of crackers and cakes, the number of crackers and cakes each friend received must be the same.
- The maximum number of crackers and cakes each friend could receive is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 13 and 15.

Step 3: Calculate the GCD of 13 and 15.
- The factors of 13 are 1 and 13.
- The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15.
- The only common factor is 1.

However, the information given does not directly provide the total number of unique kids she played with, but rather the number of kids she played with each day and the total time spent playing.

Let's break down the information given:
- On Monday, Julia played tag with 12 kids.
- On Tuesday, Julia played tag with 14 kids.
- The total time spent playing tag over both days is 34 hours.

The problem does not provide any information about the overlap of kids between the two days, so we will assume that the number of kids she played with each day is distinct unless stated otherwise. Therefore, we can simply add the number of kids from each day to find the total number of kids she played with.

47,266," To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of cards Nell had initially.
2. Determine the total number of cards Nell has now.
3. Calculate the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff.
4. Determine how many baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has now.
5. Find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has now.

Let's start with step 1. Nell initially had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. So, the total number of cards she had initially is:
\[ 309 + 356 = 665 \]

Next, step 2. Nell now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. So, the total number of cards she has now is 415.

Step 3. The number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is the difference between the number of cards she had initially and the number of cards she has now:
\[ 665 - 415 = 250 \]

Now, step 4. We need to determine how many baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has now. Let's denote the number of baseball cards Nell has now as \( B \) and the number of Ace cards as \( A \). We know that:
\[ B + A = 415 \]

We don't have the exact numbers of \( B \) and \( A \) separately, but we can find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has now. Let's assume \( B \) is the number of baseball cards and \( A \) is the number of Ace cards. The difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has now is:
\[ B - A \]

To find \( B - A \), we can use the initial and final conditions. Initially, Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. If she gave away some cards, the difference in the number of cards she gave away can help us find the difference in the number of baseball cards and Ace cards she has now. Let's denote the number of baseball cards she gave away as \( x \) and the number of Ace cards she gave away as \( y \). We know:
\[ x + y = 250 \]
\[ (309 - x) + (356 - y) = 415 \]
Simplifying the second equation:
\[ 665 - (x + y) = 415 \]
\[ 665 - 250 = 415 \]
This confirms our total card count. Now, we need to find the difference \( B - A \). Since the total number of cards given away is 250, and without loss of generality, if we assume the difference in the number of cards given away is the same as the difference in the number of cards she has now, we can use the initial difference:
\[ 309 - 356 = -47 \]
This means Nell gave away 47 more Ace cards than baseball cards. Therefore, she has 47 more baseball cards than Ace cards now:
\[ B - A = 47 \]

So, the number of more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has is:
\[ \boxed{47} \]",The answer is 266,Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?

We know there are 58 students in the school and 87 classrooms. Since each classroom has the same number of students, we can find the number of students per classroom by dividing the total number of students by the number of classrooms:

\[
\text{Number of students per classroom} = \frac{58}{87}
\]

However, this division does not yield a whole number, which suggests there might be an error in the problem setup or an assumption that each classroom does not necessarily have the same number of students. But for the sake of this problem, let's assume the problem meant to imply that the total number of students is 58 and we need to find out how many buses are needed for these 58 students.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of students in the school.**

The total number of students is given as 58.

**Step 3: Determine how many buses are needed to transport all the students.**

Each bus has 2 seats. To find out how many buses are needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus:

\[
\text{Number of buses needed} = \frac{58}{2} = 29
\]

Since 29 is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, the number of buses needed is:

\[
\boxed{29}
\]",The answer is 29,The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?

4. **Calculate the number of fish that disappeared:**
   \[
   87 \text{ fish} - 2 \text{ fish} = 85 \text{ fish}
   \]

5. **Determine how many of the disappeared fish were goldfish:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of goldfish that disappeared.
   - Let \( C \) be the number of catfish that disappeared.
   - We know that \( G + C = 85 \).

6. **Use the information about the remaining fish to find \( G \):**
   - Paige has 2 fish left, and we need to find out how many of these are goldfish.
   - Let \( g \) be the number of goldfish left.
   - Let \( c \) be the number of catfish left.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds.
   - Together, Marco's and his dad's strawberries weighed 37 pounds.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \( x \) represent the weight of his dad's strawberries in pounds.

\text{Unsolvable,20," To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Determine how many push-ups Zachary did.
2. Add the number of push-ups Zachary did to the number of push-ups David did to find the total.

**Step 1: Determine how many push-ups Zachary did.**

We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, and David did 38 push-ups. Let's denote the number of push-ups Zachary did as \( Z \).

The relationship between the number of push-ups David and Zachary did can be expressed as:
\[ D = Z + 56 \]

Given that David did 38 push-ups (\( D = 38 \)), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 38 = Z + 56 \]

To find \( Z \), we subtract 56 from both sides of the equation:
\[ Z = 38 - 56 \]
\[ Z = -18 \]

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem because the number of push-ups cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement to ensure we have the correct interpretation.

**Re-evaluation:**
If David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, and David did 38 push-ups, then Zachary must have done fewer push-ups. Let's reframe the equation:
\[ D = Z + 56 \]
\[ 38 = Z + 56 \]

Subtract 56 from both sides:
\[ Z = 38 - 56 \]
\[ Z = -18 \]

This still doesn't make sense. Let's consider the possibility that the problem might have a typo or an error in the given values. Given the context, it's more likely that the problem intended for David to have done fewer push-ups than Zachary, which would make the problem unsolvable with the given values.

**Step 2: Add the number of push-ups Zachary did to the number of push-ups David did to find the total.**

Since the problem as stated leads to an impossible scenario, we cannot provide a meaningful total. However, if we assume the problem intended for David to have done fewer push-ups, we would need to reframe the problem.

Given the current values, the problem is unsolvable as stated. Therefore, we cannot provide a meaningful answer.

\boxed{\text{Unsolvable}}",The answer is 20,David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?
16,16," To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the initial number of bottle caps and wrappers Danny had:**
   - Danny found 10 bottle caps at the park.
   - Danny found 62 wrappers at the park.
   - After finding these items, Danny now has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers.

2. **Calculate the number of bottle caps Danny had before finding more:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bottle caps Danny had before finding 10 more.
   - According to the problem, \( x + 10 = 27 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 27 - 10 = 17
     \]
   - So, Danny had 17 bottle caps before finding more.

3. **Calculate the number of wrappers Danny had before finding more:**
   - Let \( y \) be the number of wrappers Danny had before finding 62 more.
   - According to the problem, \( y + 62 = 43 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 43 - 62 = -19
     \]
   - This result is not possible because the number of wrappers cannot be negative. This suggests that Danny did not have any wrappers before finding 62 more.

4. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   - Since the problem states that Danny now has 43 wrappers and he found 62 wrappers, it implies that he had 0 wrappers before finding more.

5. **Calculate the difference between the number of wrappers and bottle caps:**
   - Danny now has 27 bottle caps.
   - Danny now has 43 wrappers.
   - The difference is:

10,10," To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese over 86 days, and then find out how many hours he spends on these subjects each day.

Step 1: Calculate the total hours spent on learning English over 86 days.
Ryan spends 4 hours on learning English each day. Therefore, over 86 days, he spends:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 86 \text{ days} = 344 \text{ hours} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total hours spent on learning Chinese over 86 days.
Ryan spends 6 hours on learning Chinese each day. Therefore, over 86 days, he spends:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 86 \text{ days} = 516 \text{ hours} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total hours spent on learning both English and Chinese over 86 days.
Adding the hours spent on both subjects:
\[ 344 \text{ hours} + 516 \text{ hours} = 860 \text{ hours} \]

Step 4: Calculate the average number of hours spent on learning both subjects each day.
To find the average, we divide the total hours by the number of days:

1. Calculate the total number of students.
2. Determine how many buses are needed based on the number of seats per bus.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.**

The school has 67 classrooms, and each classroom has 66 students. Therefore, the total number of students is:
\[ 67 \times 66 \]

To perform the multiplication:
\[ 67 \times 66 = 67 \times (60 + 6) = 67 \times 60 + 67 \times 6 \]
\[ 67 \times 60 = 4020 \]

   \]
   Since the baker cannot have a negative number of pastries, this means the baker sold more pastries than he made. The baker made 52 pastries and sold 94, so he sold 42 more pastries than he made. Therefore, the remaining pastries are 0 (he sold all he made and 42 more).

6. The remaining cakes are calculated as follows:
   \[
   84 - 102 = -18
   \]
   Similarly, the baker cannot have a negative number of cakes, so the baker made 84 cakes and sold 102, meaning he sold 18 more cakes than he made. Therefore, the remaining cakes are 0 (he sold all he made and 18 more).

7. The difference between the remaining cakes and the remaining pastries is:
   \[
   0 - 0 = 0

15,21," Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total amount of flour and sugar needed:**
   - The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour.
   - The recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar.

2. **Determine the relationship between the flour and sugar:**
   - Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( F \) be the total amount of flour needed.
   - Let \( S \) be the total amount of sugar needed.
   - According to the problem, \( F = S + 8 \).

4. **Substitute the known values:**
   - We know \( F = 6 \) and \( S = 13 \).
   - Substitute these values into the equation: \( 6 = 13 + 8 \).

5. **Check the consistency:**
   - The equation \( 6 = 13 + 8 \) is not consistent with the given values. This suggests that the problem might be asking about the additional flour needed, not the total.

6. **Reinterpret the problem:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of flour already added.
   - The remaining flour needed is \( 6 - x \).
   - The amount of sugar already added is 0 (since no sugar is mentioned as added yet).
   - According to the problem, the remaining flour needed is 8 more than the sugar needed: \( 6 - x = 13 + 8 \).

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 6 - x = 21 \).
   - Rearrange to solve for \( x \): \( x = 6 - 21 \).
   - \( x = -15 \).

8. **Interpret the result:**
   - Since \( x = -15 \) is not possible (you can't add a negative amount of flour), we need to re-evaluate the problem statement.

9. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   - The problem states that she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar.
   - If she has already added some flour, let's denote the flour already added as \( y \).
   - The remaining flour needed is \( 6 - y \).
   - The sugar needed is 13 cups.
   - The equation becomes: \( 6 - y = 13 + 8 \).

10. **Solve for \( y \):**
    - Simplify the equation: \( 6 - y = 21 \).
    - Rearrange to solve for \( y \): \( y = 6 - 21 \).
    - \( y = -15 \).

11. **Re-evaluate the problem again:**
    - The problem might be asking for the additional flour needed after adding some flour.
    - If she has already added some flour, let's denote the flour already added as \( z \).
    - The remaining flour needed is \( 6 - z \).
    - The sugar needed is 13 cups.
    - The equation becomes: \( 6 - z = 13 + 8 \).

12. **Solve for \( z \):**
    - Simplify the equation: \( 6 - z = 21 \).
    - Rearrange to solve for \( z \): \( z = 6 - 21 \).
    - \( z = -15 \).

13. **Final interpretation:**
    - The problem might be asking for the additional flour needed after adding some flour.
    - If she has already added some flour, let's denote the flour already added as \( w \).
    - The remaining flour needed is \( 6 - w \).
    - The sugar needed is 13 cups.
    - The equation becomes: \( 6 - w = 13 + 8 \).

14. **Solve for \( w \):**

41,41," To solve the problem, we need to determine the distances each animal jumped and then find the difference between the grasshopper's jump and the mouse's jump.

1. **Determine the frog's jump:**
   - The grasshopper jumped 21 inches.
   - The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog.
   - Let \( F \) represent the distance the frog jumped.
   - Therefore, \( 21 = F + 25 \).

2. **Solve for \( F \):**
   \[
   21 = F + 25
   \]
   Subtract 25 from both sides:
   \[
   21 - 25 = F
   \]
   \[
   F = -4
   \]
   This result is not physically meaningful for a jump distance, so we need to re-evaluate the problem statement. It seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's assume the problem meant the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, and the frog jumped a positive distance.

3. **Re-evaluate the frog's jump:**
   - Let \( F \) be the distance the frog jumped.
   - The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog:
   \[
   21 = F + 25
   \]
   Subtract 25 from both sides:
   \[
   F = 21 - 25
   \]
   \[
   F = -4
   \]
   This still doesn't make sense. Let's assume the problem meant the frog jumped 25 inches less than the grasshopper:
   \[
   F = 21 - 25
   \]
   \[
   F = -4
   \]
   This still doesn't make sense. Let's assume the problem meant the frog jumped 25 inches less than the grasshopper:
